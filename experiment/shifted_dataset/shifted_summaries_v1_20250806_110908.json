The DOJ&rsquo;s investigation found that CVH regularly failed to: (1) adequately protect patients from harm and undue restraints; (2) provide adequate psychiatric and psychological services; and (3) ensure adequate discharge planning and placement in the most integrated setting appropriate to each patient&rsquo;s individualized needs. The report formally put CVH on notice that failure to improve conditions would result in a lawsuit.</p>\r\n<p>On January 20, 2009, the Department of Justice filed suit against the state of Connecticut and its Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services in U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut for the aforementioned pattern of practices at CVH, that violated the constitutional and federal statutory rights of patients under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1997 (CRIPA). The lawsuit was filed along with a settlement agreement and joint motion to dismiss. &nbsp;Judge Alvin W. Thompson approved the settlement on July 8, 2009 and conditionally dismissed the suit.</p>\r\n<p>In the settlement, Connecticut agreed to a wide variety of practice changes and a period of supervised operation. The state agreed to provide care and treatment &ldquo;based on professional standards of practice that shall seek to: A. ameliorate symptoms such that a less restrictive locus of treatment may safely be employed; B. strengthen and support individuals&rsquo; rehabilitation and recovery; and C. enable individuals and grow and develop in ways benefiting their health and well-being.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The settlement called for an environment that maximizes safety and is predicated on respect between the staff and those whom they serve. In addition, it mandated implementation of integrated treatment plans and interdisciplinary staff teams to increase the efficacy of treatment provided. Furthermore, the settlement outlined extensive changes in the psychiatric and psychological care provided in order to increase the safety and wellbeing of patients while also reducing the risk of harm and suicide that was extensive at CVH. Across the board, the settlement emphasized that care provided be consistent with generally accepted professional standards of care and that the environment at CVH be sufficiently humane to reduce the risk of harm. The settlement outlined a 48-month period of supervised implementation after which the agreement would terminate provided that CVH had demonstrated substantial compliance with the terms.</p>\r\n<p>On September 25, 2013, the Court approved a notice of substantial compliance with certain terms of the settlement agreement and extension of termination that was filed by the State. On May 22, 2015, the Court approved the State&rsquo;s notice of substantial compliance and motion to terminate the settlement agreement, effectively terminating the Court&rsquo;s ability to enforce the agreement.</p>\r\n<p>Although the notice of substantial compliance and motion to terminate was accepted and granted, news suggests that as late as mid-2017, patients at the Connecticut Valley Hospital continued to suffer from widespread abuse.

On August 6, 2007, the DOJ reported its findings to the governor, concluding CVH routinely failed to adequately protect patients from harm, provide sufficient psychiatric and psychological services, and ensure proper discharge planning and placement.

A 2007 report found CVH failed to protect patients, provide adequate psychiatric/psychological services, and ensure proper discharge, warning of litigation. In January 2009, the DOJ filed suit against the State of Connecticut and its Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services in U.S. District Court, alleging constitutional and federal statutory rights violations.\n\n*   Concurrently with the complaint, a settlement agreement was filed and approved by Judge Alvin W. Thompson in July 2009, conditionally dismissing the action. The settlement mandated Connecticut implement extensive supervised practice changes, including providing care based on professional standards for symptom amelioration, rehabilitation, and patient well-being. It required an environment maximizing patient safety and mutual respect, integrated treatment plans, and interdisciplinary teams.\n\n*   The agreement established a 48-month supervised implementation period, terminating upon substantial compliance. The Court approved the State's notices of substantial compliance, extending the agreement's termination on September 25, 2013, and subsequently approving the motion to terminate on May 22, 2015, which concluded its enforcement authority over the settlement.\n\n*   Despite the Court's termination approval, news reports indicated continued widespread abuse at CVH through mid-2017. On September 6, 2017, Connecticut State Police announced the arrests of nine CVH employees for cruelty to persons and disorderly conduct, with media detailing staff-perpetrated violence, humiliation, and sexual harassment against patients.",

The DOJ&rsquo;s investigation found that CVH regularly failed to: (1) adequately protect patients from harm and undue restraints; (2) provide adequate psychiatric and psychological services; and (3) ensure adequate discharge planning and placement in the most integrated setting appropriate to each patient&rsquo;s individualized needs. The report formally put CVH on notice that failure to improve conditions would result in a lawsuit.</p>\r\n<p>On January 20, 2009, the Department of Justice filed suit against the state of Connecticut and its Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services in U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut for the aforementioned pattern of practices at CVH, that violated the constitutional and federal statutory rights of patients under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1997 (CRIPA). The lawsuit was filed along with a settlement agreement and joint motion to dismiss. &nbsp;Judge Alvin W.

In addition, it mandated implementation of integrated treatment plans and interdisciplinary staff teams to increase the efficacy of treatment provided. Furthermore, the settlement outlined extensive changes in the psychiatric and psychological care provided in order to increase the safety and wellbeing of patients while also reducing the risk of harm and suicide that was extensive at CVH. Across the board, the settlement emphasized that care provided be consistent with generally accepted professional standards of care and that the environment at CVH be sufficiently humane to reduce the risk of harm. The settlement outlined a 48-month period of supervised implementation after which the agreement would terminate provided that CVH had demonstrated substantial compliance with the terms.</p>\r\n<p>On September 25, 2013, the Court approved a notice of substantial compliance with certain terms of the settlement agreement and extension of termination that was filed by the State. On May 22, 2015, the Court approved the State&rsquo;s notice of substantial compliance and motion to terminate the settlement agreement, effectively terminating the Court&rsquo;s ability to enforce the agreement.</p>\r\n<p>Although the notice of substantial compliance and motion to terminate was accepted and granted, news suggests that as late as mid-2017, patients at the Connecticut Valley Hospital continued to suffer from widespread abuse.

CVH is Connecticut's biggest state-run mental hospital. This was done under a federal law called the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, or CRIPA.\n\nThe DOJ sent a report of what it found to Connecticut's governor on August 6, 2007. The investigation showed that CVH regularly failed to: (1) keep patients safe from harm and from being restrained too much; (2) provide enough mental health care; and (3) plan for patients to leave the hospital and live in settings that were as normal as possible. The report officially warned CVH that if things didn't get better, the DOJ would sue.\n\nOn January 20, 2009, the Justice Department sued the state of Connecticut and its Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services in a U.S. District Court in Connecticut. The lawsuit claimed that CVH's practices violated patients' basic rights under the U.S. Constitution and federal law, specifically CRIPA. The DOJ filed the lawsuit along with a proposed agreement to settle the case and a joint request to drop the suit. Judge Alvin W. Thompson approved the settlement on July 8, 2009, and dismissed the lawsuit, but with certain conditions.\n\nAs part of the settlement, Connecticut agreed to make many changes to how it operated and to be overseen for a period of time. The state promised to provide care and treatment that met professional standards. This care would aim to: A. lessen symptoms so patients could be treated in places with fewer restrictions; B. help patients get better and recover; and C. help patients grow and develop for their overall health.\n\nThe settlement required an environment that was as safe as possible and based on mutual respect between staff and patients. It also required using combined treatment plans and teams of staff from different areas of expertise to make treatment work better. Also, the settlement outlined major changes to mental health care. These changes aimed to improve patient safety and well-being, and lower the high risk of harm and suicide that was common at CVH. Overall, the agreement stressed that all care must meet accepted professional standards and that CVH's environment must be kind and safe enough to reduce the risk of harm. The settlement set a 48-month (four-year) period for these supervised changes. After this time, the agreement would end if CVH showed it had mostly followed the rules.\n\nOn September 25, 2013, the Court approved a request from the State, which said CVH had mostly followed some parts of the settlement and asked for more time before the agreement ended. Then, on May 22, 2015, the Court approved the State's notice that it had largely complied and its request to end the settlement agreement. This meant the Court could no longer force the hospital to follow the agreement.\n\nEven though the Court accepted the notice that CVH had complied and allowed the agreement to end, news reports show that patients at Connecticut Valley Hospital continued to suffer widespread abuse as late as mid-2017.

              "transformed_text": "On December 19, 2005, the U.S. government's Justice Department, specifically its Civil Rights team, started looking into how things were being run at Connecticut Valley Hospital (CVH). CVH is Connecticut's biggest state mental hospital. This investigation was done under a federal law called CRIPA, which protects the rights of people in institutions like hospitals.\n\nThe Justice Department sent a report about what they discovered to Connecticut's governor on August 6, 2007. The investigation showed that CVH often failed to: (1) keep patients safe from harm and from being held back or tied down too much; (2) provide enough mental health care; and (3) help patients prepare to leave the hospital and live in the community as much as possible. The report officially warned the hospital that if they didn't fix these problems, the government would take them to court.\n\nOn January 20, 2009, the Justice Department took the state of Connecticut and its mental health department to federal court in Connecticut. The lawsuit claimed that the hospital's practices broke patients' basic rights, which are protected by the U.S. Constitution and federal laws like CRIPA. The Justice Department filed the lawsuit, but also presented a possible agreement to solve the problem without a long trial. Both sides asked the judge to end the lawsuit based on this agreement. Judge Alvin W. Thompson approved the agreement on July 8, 2009, and ended the lawsuit, but with certain rules the hospital had to follow.\n\nIn this agreement, Connecticut agreed to make many changes to how it operated and to be watched closely for a while. The state promised to provide care and treatment that met the best professional standards. This care would aim to: A. reduce their symptoms so they could be treated in less strict environments; B. help patients heal and get back on their feet; and C. help patients grow and improve their overall health.\n\nThe agreement demanded a hospital environment that was as safe as possible and where staff and patients respected each other. It also required using team-based care plans with different types of experts working together to make treatment more effective. Furthermore, the agreement also detailed big changes to how mental health care was given. These changes were meant to make patients safer, improve their well-being, and lower the high risk of harm and suicide that was common at CVH. Overall, the agreement emphasized that all care had to meet accepted professional standards, and the hospital environment needed to be kind and safe to reduce any risk of harm. The agreement set a four-year period for these changes to be watched. After this time, the agreement would end if the hospital showed it had largely kept its promises.\n\nOn September 25, 2013, the Court approved a request from the State. Connecticut said the hospital had mostly met some parts of the agreement and asked for more time before it ended. Then, on May 22, 2015, the Court approved the State's statement that it had mostly fulfilled the agreement and its request to end it. This meant the court could no longer make the hospital follow the agreement.\n\nEven though the court agreed the hospital had met its promises and let the agreement end, news reports show that patients at the Connecticut Valley Hospital continued to suffer a lot of abuse even into mid-2017. On September 6, 2017, Connecticut State Police announced they had arrested nine CVH employees. They were accused of being cruel to people and causing disturbances. News reports described patients being victims of violence, humiliation, and sexual harassment by hospital staff.",

The DOJ&rsquo;s investigation found that CVH regularly failed to: (1) adequately protect patients from harm and undue restraints; (2) provide adequate psychiatric and psychological services; and (3) ensure adequate discharge planning and placement in the most integrated setting appropriate to each patient&rsquo;s individualized needs. The report formally put CVH on notice that failure to improve conditions would result in a lawsuit.</p>\r\n<p>On January 20, 2009, the Department of Justice filed suit against the state of Connecticut and its Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services in U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut for the aforementioned pattern of practices at CVH, that violated the constitutional and federal statutory rights of patients under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1997 (CRIPA). The lawsuit was filed along with a settlement agreement and joint motion to dismiss. &nbsp;Judge Alvin W.

In addition, it mandated implementation of integrated treatment plans and interdisciplinary staff teams to increase the efficacy of treatment provided. Furthermore, the settlement outlined extensive changes in the psychiatric and psychological care provided in order to increase the safety and wellbeing of patients while also reducing the risk of harm and suicide that was extensive at CVH. Across the board, the settlement emphasized that care provided be consistent with generally accepted professional standards of care and that the environment at CVH be sufficiently humane to reduce the risk of harm. The settlement outlined a 48-month period of supervised implementation after which the agreement would terminate provided that CVH had demonstrated substantial compliance with the terms.</p>\r\n<p>On September 25, 2013, the Court approved a notice of substantial compliance with certain terms of the settlement agreement and extension of termination that was filed by the State.

              "transformed_text": "As a legal historian, one might trace the origins of the Department of Justice's involvement with the Connecticut Valley Hospital (CVH) back to December 19, 2005. At that time, the DOJ's Civil Rights Division launched an investigation into the conditions at CVH, the state's largest psychiatric hospital. The purpose was to ascertain whether the hospital was upholding the fundamental rights of its patients, as mandated by the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA).\n\nThe findings, delivered to Connecticut's governor on August 6, 2007, painted a grim picture: CVH consistently failed to protect patients from harm, provide adequate psychiatric care, or prepare them for discharge. This report served as a critical warning, a formal notice to the state that unless these egregious conditions improved, the DOJ would be compelled to take legal action.\n\nWhen improvements were not forthcoming, the Department of Justice, on January 20, 2009, took the significant step of filing a lawsuit against the state of Connecticut and its Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services. This action was a direct response to the persistent pattern of practices at CVH that violated patients' constitutional and federal rights under CRIPA. Crucially, this lawsuit was not initiated as an adversarial battle but as a means to formalize an already negotiated path to reform. It was filed concurrently with a settlement agreement and a joint motion to dismiss, signifying that both parties had reached an understanding. The strategic purpose of this joint motion was to allow the court to immediately approve the terms of the settlement and conditionally close the case, thereby avoiding a protracted trial and allowing the agreed-upon changes to commence swiftly under judicial oversight. Judge Alvin W. Thompson approved this settlement on July 8, 2009, marking the formal beginning of the reform period.\n\nThe settlement itself was a comprehensive blueprint for change, obligating Connecticut to implement a wide array of practice reforms and submit to a period of supervised operation. Its core aim was to transform CVH into an environment that prioritized patient safety, dignity, and effective, professional care, ensuring individuals could recover and thrive. This included mandates for integrated treatment plans, interdisciplinary staff teams, and extensive changes to psychiatric and psychological care, all designed to reduce harm and promote well-being. The agreement stipulated a 48-month period of supervised implementation, after which the oversight would cease, provided CVH demonstrated substantial compliance.\n\nYears later, on September 25, 2013, the state signaled its progress, leading the Court to approve a notice of substantial compliance with certain terms and an extension of the agreement. Ultimately, on May 22, 2015, the state filed a notice of substantial compliance and a motion to terminate the settlement agreement. The court's approval of this motion meant that the period of judicial enforcement had concluded; the state asserted, and the court accepted, that the hospital had sufficiently reformed itself, and external oversight was no longer deemed necessary.\n\nHowever, the historical record reveals a troubling postscript. Despite the official termination of the settlement, reports as late as mid-2017 suggested that patients at CVH continued to endure widespread abuse. On September 6, 2017, the Connecticut State Police announced the arrests of nine CVH employees on charges of cruelty to persons and disorderly conduct. Subsequent media reports vividly detailed instances of violence, humiliation, and sexual harassment, casting a long shadow over the efficacy and lasting impact of the earlier legal intervention.",

              "transformed_text": "The central legal conflict in this case revolved around whether the Connecticut Valley Hospital (CVH), the state's largest psychiatric hospital, was upholding the fundamental rights of its patients as mandated by the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA). After an investigation revealed severe patient rights violations, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the State of Connecticut, which was quickly resolved through a court-approved settlement agreement.\n\nThe Department of Justice's investigation, initiated in 2005, found that CVH consistently failed to protect patients from harm, provide adequate psychiatric care, or prepare them for discharge. This grim report, delivered in 2007, served as a critical warning that unless these egregious conditions improved, legal action would follow. When improvements were not forthcoming, the Department of Justice filed suit in 2009. This action was not initiated as an adversarial battle, but rather as a means to formalize an already negotiated path to reform, with the court immediately approving the terms of a comprehensive settlement. This judicial approval in 2009 marked the formal beginning of the reform period.\n\nThe settlement itself was a comprehensive blueprint for change, obligating Connecticut to implement a wide array of practice reforms and submit to a period of supervised operation. Its core aim was to transform CVH into an environment that prioritized patient safety, dignity, and effective, professional care, ensuring individuals could recover and thrive. This included mandates for integrated treatment plans, interdisciplinary staff teams, and extensive changes to psychiatric and psychological care, all designed to reduce harm and promote well-being. The agreement stipulated a 48-month period of supervised implementation, after which oversight would cease, provided CVH demonstrated substantial compliance.\n\nYears later, in 2015, the state asserted, and the court accepted, that the hospital had sufficiently reformed itself, leading to the termination of the settlement agreement and the conclusion of judicial enforcement.\n\nHowever, the narrative reveals a troubling postscript: despite the official termination of the settlement, reports as late as mid-2017 suggested that patients at CVH continued to endure widespread abuse. This culminated in the arrests of nine CVH employees on charges of cruelty to persons and disorderly conduct, with subsequent media reports detailing vivid instances of violence, humiliation, and sexual harassment, casting a long shadow over the efficacy and lasting impact of the earlier legal intervention.",

        "summary": "<p>On October 25, 2013, the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program (ADAP) filed this lawsuit in the District Court for the Southern District of Alabama. The plaintiff, which served as Alabama’s designated protection and advocacy program for people with disabilities, sued SafetyNet Youthcare, Inc. (SafetyNet) under the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act of 1986 (PAIMI), the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (PADD Act), and the Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Program of 1993 (PAIR). The plaintiff alleged that SafetyNet had unlawfully failed to allow it, as Alabama’s Protection and Advocacy (P&A) provider, to monitor the defendant's facilities. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had failed to grant ADAP access to facilities used for SafetyNet Academy, a program operated by the defendant for male youths with emotional or behavioral disabilities. The plaintiff claimed that, despite several attempts to explain to the staff at SafetyNet Academy why they were required by law to allow ADAP into all of the Academy's facilities for monitoring and investigation purposes, the defendant repeatedly refused to grant ADAP access to what it referred to as its Moderate Program. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and a preliminary injunction to compel the SafetyNet Academy to grant them reasonable access to the facilities.</p><p>On December 2, 2013 – the same day the defendant filed an answer denying that it was required to allow the plaintiff access to its Moderate Program – it also filed a third-party complaint against the Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR). SafetyNet claimed that, because it had acted on the advice and counsel of DHR, which served as its licensing authority, any potential violations on its own part were caused by DHR. On this basis, it sought indemnification from DHR for any recovery that may be received by the plaintiff against SafetyNet. </p><p>Unable to agree on terms of a settlement, the parties proceeded with discovery. On September 19, 2014, all three parties moved for summary judgment. While the plaintiff held onto its position that it was allowed access to all of SafetyNet Academy’s programs, the defendants argued that because the individuals in the Moderate Program had moderate (rather than severe) mental illness, they were excluded from P&A protection. </p><p>Shortly afterward, on October 14, 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) submitted a statement of interest supporting the plaintiff’s position that summary judgment against the defendants was appropriate. The DOJ asserted that the defendant’s facilities at SafetyNet Academy fell squarely within the parameters of PAIMI regulations and, as such, the plaintiff must be granted reasonable unrestricted access to all of the academy’s programs. </p><p>On December 12, 2014, Judge Callie V.S. Grande awarded summary judgment to the plaintiff, denying both defendants’ requests for summary judgment as well as SafetyNet’s request for indemnification and contribution against DHR. The judge found that, as a facility that provided residential treatment for individuals with mental illness and other disabilities, PAIMI, PADD, and PAIR applied to SafetyNet Academy. Rejecting defendants’ assertion that individuals with moderate mental illness may be excluded from P&A protection, she emphasized that the protections offered by these laws were intended to be broad in scope and did not define P&A access “one resident at a time.” Accordingly, Judge Grande held that ADAP was authorized to monitor all SafetyNet Academy programs and must be allowed reasonable access by law and awarded declaratory and permanent injunctive relief to the plaintiff. She also ordered ADAP and SafetyNet to meet and prepare a protocol for ADAP’s monitoring and investigation visits. Finally, the order denied SafetyNet’s request for indemnification against DHR and held that each party should bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs. 65 F.Supp.3d 1312.</p><p>The parties met and submitted access protocol on January 30, 2015. In addition to describing ADAP’s scope of access to SafetyNet and its records, the protocol outlined procedures ADAP may follow should SafetyNet deny or delay access to its facilities in the future. </p><p>Also following the grant of summary judgment, ADAP submitted a motion for reconsideration of the court’s denial of attorneys’ fees and costs. On February 11, 2015, Judge Grande issued an order awarding the plaintiff filing fees as the prevailing party. However, the order denied the plaintiff attorneys’ fees, citing a failure to raise an applicable exception to the American Rule stating that litigants are generally expected to bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs. 2015 WL 566946.</p>",

SafetyNet claimed that DHR, its licensing authority, caused any potential violations by advising its actions, seeking indemnification from DHR for any recovery by ADAP against SafetyNet.\n\nUnable to agree on settlement terms, the parties proceeded with discovery. All three parties subsequently moved for summary judgment. ADAP maintained its right to access all Academy programs, while defendants argued individuals in the Moderate Program, having moderate rather than severe mental illness, were excluded from P&A protection.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) submitted a statement of interest supporting ADAP’s summary judgment position. DOJ asserted SafetyNet Academy facilities fell squarely within PAIMI regulations, thus requiring reasonable, unrestricted access to all programs.\n\nOn December 12, 2014, Judge Callie V.S. Grande awarded summary judgment to ADAP, denying both defendants’ requests for summary judgment and SafetyNet’s indemnification and contribution claims against DHR. The court found that SafetyNet Academy, as a residential treatment facility for individuals with mental illness and other disabilities, was subject to PAIMI, PADD, and PAIR. Rejecting defendants’ assertion that moderate mental illness excluded individuals from P&A protection, the court emphasized the broad scope of these laws, which do not define P&A access \"one resident at a time.\" Accordingly, Judge Grande held ADAP was authorized to monitor all SafetyNet Academy programs, mandating reasonable access by law, and awarded declaratory and permanent injunctive relief. She also ordered ADAP and SafetyNet to meet and prepare a protocol for ADAP’s monitoring and investigation visits. The order also denied SafetyNet’s indemnification request against DHR and directed each party to bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs. 65 F.Supp.3d 1312.\n\nThe parties met and submitted an access protocol. This protocol detailed ADAP’s scope of access to SafetyNet and its records, outlining procedures for ADAP should SafetyNet deny or delay future access to its facilities.\n\nFollowing the summary judgment grant, ADAP submitted a motion for reconsideration of the court’s denial of attorneys’ fees and costs. On February 11, 2015, Judge Grande issued an order awarding ADAP filing fees as the prevailing party. However, the order denied attorneys’ fees, citing ADAP’s failure to raise an applicable exception to the American Rule, which generally requires litigants to bear their own fees and costs. 2015 WL 566946.",

              "text": "<p>On October 25, 2013, the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program (ADAP) filed this lawsuit in the District Court for the Southern District of Alabama. The plaintiff, which served as Alabama’s designated protection and advocacy program for people with disabilities, sued SafetyNet Youthcare, Inc. (SafetyNet) under the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act of 1986 (PAIMI), the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (PADD Act), and the Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Program of 1993 (PAIR). The plaintiff alleged that SafetyNet had unlawfully failed to allow it, as Alabama’s Protection and Advocacy (P&A) provider, to monitor the defendant's facilities. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had failed to grant ADAP access to facilities used for SafetyNet Academy, a program operated by the defendant for male youths with emotional or behavioral disabilities. The plaintiff claimed that, despite several attempts to explain to the staff at SafetyNet Academy why they were required by law to allow ADAP into all of the Academy's facilities for monitoring and investigation purposes, the defendant repeatedly refused to grant ADAP access to what it referred to as its Moderate Program. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and a preliminary injunction to compel the SafetyNet Academy to grant them reasonable access to the facilities.</p><p>On December 2, 2013 – the same day the defendant filed an answer denying that it was required to allow the plaintiff access to its Moderate Program – it also filed a third-party complaint against the Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR). SafetyNet claimed that, because it had acted on the advice and counsel of DHR, which served as its licensing authority, any potential violations on its own part were caused by DHR. On this basis, it sought indemnification from DHR for any recovery that may be received by the plaintiff against SafetyNet. </p><p>Unable to agree on terms of a settlement, the parties proceeded with discovery. On September 19, 2014, all three parties moved for summary judgment. While the plaintiff held onto its position that it was allowed access to all of SafetyNet Academy’s programs, the defendants argued that because the individuals in the Moderate Program had moderate (rather than severe) mental illness, they were excluded from P&A protection. </p><p>Shortly afterward, on October 14, 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) submitted a statement of interest supporting the plaintiff’s position that summary judgment against the defendants was appropriate. The DOJ asserted that the defendant’s facilities at SafetyNet Academy fell squarely within the parameters of PAIMI regulations and, as such, the plaintiff must be granted reasonable unrestricted access to all of the academy’s programs. </p><p>On December 12, 2014, Judge Callie V.S. Grande awarded summary judgment to the plaintiff, denying both defendants’ requests for summary judgment as well as SafetyNet’s request for indemnification and contribution against DHR. The judge found that, as a facility that provided residential treatment for individuals with mental illness and other disabilities, PAIMI, PADD, and PAIR applied to SafetyNet Academy. Rejecting defendants’ assertion that individuals with moderate mental illness may be excluded from P&A protection, she emphasized that the protections offered by these laws were intended to be broad in scope and did not define P&A access “one resident at a time.” Accordingly, Judge Grande held that ADAP was authorized to monitor all SafetyNet Academy programs and must be allowed reasonable access by law and awarded declaratory and permanent injunctive relief to the plaintiff. She also ordered ADAP and SafetyNet to meet and prepare a protocol for ADAP’s monitoring and investigation visits. Finally, the order denied SafetyNet’s request for indemnification against DHR and held that each party should bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs. 65 F.Supp.3d 1312.</p><p>The parties met and submitted access protocol on January 30, 2015.

              "transformed_text": "On October 25, 2013, the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program (ADAP) filed this lawsuit in the District Court for the Southern District of Alabama. ADAP, which is Alabama's official program for protecting people with disabilities, sued SafetyNet Youthcare, Inc. (SafetyNet). ADAP claimed SafetyNet violated federal laws that protect people with disabilities, including the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act (PAIMI), the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (PADD Act), and the Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Program (PAIR). ADAP alleged that SafetyNet illegally prevented it, as the state's P&A provider, from monitoring SafetyNet's facilities. Specifically, ADAP claimed SafetyNet did not allow it into facilities used by SafetyNet Academy, a program for young males with emotional or behavioral disabilities. ADAP stated that it tried many times to explain to SafetyNet Academy staff that the law required them to allow ADAP into all facilities for monitoring and investigations. However, SafetyNet repeatedly refused ADAP access to what it called its \"Moderate Program.\" ADAP asked the court for an order declaring its rights and a temporary order to force SafetyNet Academy to grant reasonable access to its facilities.\n\nOn December 2, 2013, SafetyNet filed its response, denying it had to allow ADAP into its Moderate Program. On the same day, SafetyNet also filed a separate claim against the Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR). SafetyNet argued that DHR, its licensing authority, had advised it. Therefore, SafetyNet claimed DHR was responsible for any potential wrongdoing. Based on this, SafetyNet asked DHR to pay for any money ADAP might win from SafetyNet.\n\nThe parties could not agree on a settlement, so they moved forward with exchanging information and evidence. On September 19, 2014, all three parties asked the judge to rule in their favor without a full trial. ADAP maintained its position that it should have access to all of SafetyNet Academy’s programs. However, the defendants argued that individuals in the Moderate Program had only moderate, not severe, mental illness, and therefore were not covered by P&A protections.\n\nSoon after, on October 14, 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed an official statement supporting ADAP. The DOJ agreed that the judge should rule in ADAP's favor against the defendants without a trial. The DOJ stated that SafetyNet Academy’s facilities clearly met the requirements of PAIMI rules. Therefore, ADAP must be given reasonable, unrestricted access to all of the academy’s programs.\n\nOn December 12, 2014, Judge Callie V.S. Grande ruled in favor of ADAP without a trial. She rejected both defendants’ requests for similar rulings and SafetyNet’s request for reimbursement from DHR. The judge determined that SafetyNet Academy, as a facility offering residential treatment for people with mental illness and other disabilities, was subject to the PAIMI, PADD, and PAIR laws. She rejected the defendants’ argument that people with moderate mental illness could be excluded from P&A protection. The judge stressed that these laws were meant to provide broad protection and did not limit P&A access to only certain residents. Therefore, Judge Grande ruled that ADAP had the authority to monitor all SafetyNet Academy programs and must be allowed reasonable access by law. She issued an order declaring ADAP's rights and a permanent order forcing SafetyNet to comply. She also ordered ADAP and SafetyNet to meet and create a plan for ADAP’s monitoring and investigation visits. Finally, the order denied SafetyNet’s request for DHR to pay its costs and ruled that each party should pay its own legal fees and costs. 65 F.Supp.3d 1312.\n\nThe parties met and submitted their access plan on January 30, 2015. This plan described ADAP’s allowed access to SafetyNet and its records. It also outlined steps ADAP could take if SafetyNet denied or delayed access to its facilities in the future.\n\nAfter the judge ruled in its favor, ADAP also asked the court to reconsider its decision to deny legal fees and costs. On February 11, 2015, Judge Grande issued an order awarding ADAP its filing fees, as it was the winning party. However, the order denied ADAP's request for attorney fees. The judge stated that ADAP failed to show an exception to the general rule in the U.S. that parties usually pay their own legal fees and costs. 2015 WL 566946.",

              "transformed_text": "Imagine a group called the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program, or ADAP, which is like a watchdog for people with disabilities in Alabama. In 2013, ADAP took a company called SafetyNet Youthcare to court. ADAP said SafetyNet was breaking federal laws designed to protect people with disabilities. Think of these laws as a shield for people with mental illnesses or developmental disabilities.\n\nWhat was the problem? ADAP claimed SafetyNet illegally blocked them from visiting their facilities, even though ADAP's job is to protect people with disabilities. SafetyNet ran a program called SafetyNet Academy for young men with emotional or behavioral challenges. ADAP said SafetyNet wouldn't let them into these places. ADAP tried repeatedly to explain that the law *required* SafetyNet to let them in to check things out, like a health inspector checking a restaurant. But SafetyNet kept saying no, especially to a part they called their \"Moderate Program.\" So, ADAP asked the court to step in and basically say, \"Yes, ADAP has the right to be there,\" and to issue a temporary order to force SafetyNet to let them in.\n\nSafetyNet fought back, saying they didn't have to let ADAP into their \"Moderate Program.\" On the same day, SafetyNet also pointed a finger at another government agency, the Alabama Department of Human Resources, or DHR. SafetyNet claimed DHR, which gives them their operating license (like a driver's license for a business), had given them bad advice. They argued that if they were breaking any laws, it was DHR's fault. SafetyNet even asked DHR to pay any money ADAP might win from them if ADAP won the lawsuit.\n\nSince they couldn't settle things out of court, they went through a process called \"discovery,\" where both sides share information and evidence, like preparing for a big debate. Eventually, all three groups asked the judge to make a decision without a full trial. This is called \"summary judgment\" – basically asking the judge to say, \"Based on the facts we have, it's clear who should win.\" ADAP kept insisting it should be allowed into *all* of SafetyNet Academy's programs. But SafetyNet and DHR argued that the laws only applied to people with *severe* mental illnesses, not those in their \"Moderate Program\" who, they claimed, had less severe issues.\n\nThen, a powerful government agency, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), stepped in. They filed an official statement saying they agreed with ADAP. The DOJ said the judge should rule for ADAP against both SafetyNet and DHR, without needing a trial. They argued that SafetyNet Academy's facilities clearly fell under the rules of the disability protection laws. And because of that, ADAP *must* be allowed full access to *all* of the academy's programs.\n\nOn December 12, 2014, the judge, Callie V.S. Grande, made her decision. She sided with ADAP, deciding the case without a full trial. She said no to SafetyNet and DHR's requests to rule in their favor, and also rejected SafetyNet's demand for DHR to pay its legal bills. The judge explained that SafetyNet Academy, because it provided care for people with mental illnesses and other disabilities, *had* to follow those important disability protection laws. She specifically disagreed with SafetyNet and DHR's idea that people with \"moderate\" mental illness could be left out of these protections. The judge emphasized that these laws were designed to protect *everyone* with disabilities, not just those with severe issues, and that ADAP's access wasn't limited to specific residents. So, Judge Grande officially ruled that ADAP had the legal right to check on *all* of SafetyNet Academy's programs and *must* be allowed reasonable access. She issued an order, like a firm command, stating ADAP's rights and permanently forcing SafetyNet to follow the law. She also told ADAP and SafetyNet to work together and create a plan for how ADAP would conduct its visits and investigations. Finally, the judge said SafetyNet couldn't make DHR pay its costs, and that generally, each side had to pay its own lawyers.\n\nADAP and SafetyNet did meet and submitted their access plan to the court a few weeks later. This plan spelled out exactly how ADAP would be allowed to visit SafetyNet and look at its records. It also included steps ADAP could take if SafetyNet ever tried to block or delay their access again.\n\nAfter winning, ADAP also asked the court to reconsider its decision about legal fees. On February 11, 2015, Judge Grande said ADAP *would* get back its filing fees (the money paid to start the lawsuit) because they won. But she said no to ADAP's request for their attorney fees (the money paid to their lawyers). The judge explained that in the U.S., generally, each side pays for its own lawyers, and ADAP didn't show a special reason why this rule should be different in their case.",

ADAP said SafetyNet was not following laws. These laws protect people with mental health issues or learning problems.\n\nADAP said SafetyNet stopped them from visiting. ADAP's job is to check on places that help people with disabilities. SafetyNet ran a program called SafetyNet Academy. It helped young men with emotional problems. ADAP said SafetyNet would not let them visit. ADAP tried to explain the law. The law said SafetyNet had to let them in. It was like a health check. But SafetyNet kept saying no. They especially said no to their \"Moderate Program.\" So, ADAP asked a judge for help. They wanted the judge to say ADAP had the right to visit. They also wanted a quick order to make SafetyNet let them in.\n\nSafetyNet fought back. They said ADAP didn't need to visit their \"Moderate Program.\" SafetyNet also blamed another group. This group was the Alabama Department of Human Resources, or DHR. DHR gives SafetyNet its license to operate. SafetyNet said DHR gave them wrong advice. They said if they broke any laws, it was DHR's fault. SafetyNet even asked DHR to pay for any money ADAP might win.\n\nThey could not agree outside of court. So, they shared information. This is like getting ready for a big argument. Later, all three groups asked the judge to decide. They wanted the judge to make a choice without a long trial. This is called \"summary judgment.\" It means asking the judge to say who should win based on the facts. ADAP said it should be able to visit *all* of SafetyNet Academy's programs. But SafetyNet and DHR said the laws only covered people with *very serious* mental illnesses. They said the \"Moderate Program\" was for people with less serious problems.\n\nThen, a big government group got involved. It was the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ. The DOJ said they agreed with ADAP. They said the judge should rule for ADAP. They said SafetyNet and DHR were wrong. The DOJ said SafetyNet Academy had to follow the disability laws. So, ADAP *must* be allowed to visit *all* of its programs.\n\nOn December 12, 2014, the judge made her decision. Her name was Callie V.S. Grande. She agreed with ADAP. She decided the case without a long trial. She said no to SafetyNet and DHR's requests. She also said no to SafetyNet wanting DHR to pay its legal bills. The judge said SafetyNet Academy helped people with mental illnesses. So, it *had* to follow the disability laws. She did not agree that people with \"moderate\" mental illness could be left out. The judge said these laws protect *everyone* with disabilities. They are not just for people with very serious issues. ADAP's visits were not limited to certain people. So, Judge Grande ruled that ADAP had the right to check *all* of SafetyNet Academy's programs. SafetyNet *must* let them visit. She gave a strong order. It said ADAP's rights. It made SafetyNet follow the law forever. She also told ADAP and SafetyNet to work together. They had to make a plan for ADAP's visits. Lastly, the judge said SafetyNet could not make DHR pay its costs. She said each side usually pays for its own lawyers.\n\nADAP and SafetyNet met. They sent their visit plan to the court a few weeks later. This plan showed how ADAP could visit SafetyNet. It also showed how ADAP could look at records. The plan also said what ADAP could do if SafetyNet ever tried to stop them again.\n\nAfter winning, ADAP asked the court about legal costs. On February 11, 2015, Judge Grande made another decision. She said ADAP *would* get back the money it paid to start the lawsuit. This was because they won. But she said no to ADAP asking for money for their lawyers. The judge said that in the U.S., groups usually pay for their own lawyers. ADAP did not show a special reason to change this rule.",

              "text": "<p>On October 25, 2013, the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program (ADAP) filed this lawsuit in the District Court for the Southern District of Alabama. The plaintiff, which served as Alabama’s designated protection and advocacy program for people with disabilities, sued SafetyNet Youthcare, Inc. (SafetyNet) under the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act of 1986 (PAIMI), the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (PADD Act), and the Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Program of 1993 (PAIR). The plaintiff alleged that SafetyNet had unlawfully failed to allow it, as Alabama’s Protection and Advocacy (P&A) provider, to monitor the defendant's facilities. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had failed to grant ADAP access to facilities used for SafetyNet Academy, a program operated by the defendant for male youths with emotional or behavioral disabilities. The plaintiff claimed that, despite several attempts to explain to the staff at SafetyNet Academy why they were required by law to allow ADAP into all of the Academy's facilities for monitoring and investigation purposes, the defendant repeatedly refused to grant ADAP access to what it referred to as its Moderate Program. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and a preliminary injunction to compel the SafetyNet Academy to grant them reasonable access to the facilities.</p><p>On December 2, 2013 – the same day the defendant filed an answer denying that it was required to allow the plaintiff access to its Moderate Program – it also filed a third-party complaint against the Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR). SafetyNet claimed that, because it had acted on the advice and counsel of DHR, which served as its licensing authority, any potential violations on its own part were caused by DHR. On this basis, it sought indemnification from DHR for any recovery that may be received by the plaintiff against SafetyNet. </p><p>Unable to agree on terms of a settlement, the parties proceeded with discovery. On September 19, 2014, all three parties moved for summary judgment. While the plaintiff held onto its position that it was allowed access to all of SafetyNet Academy’s programs, the defendants argued that because the individuals in the Moderate Program had moderate (rather than severe) mental illness, they were excluded from P&A protection. </p><p>Shortly afterward, on October 14, 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) submitted a statement of interest supporting the plaintiff’s position that summary judgment against the defendants was appropriate. The DOJ asserted that the defendant’s facilities at SafetyNet Academy fell squarely within the parameters of PAIMI regulations and, as such, the plaintiff must be granted reasonable unrestricted access to all of the academy’s programs. </p><p>On December 12, 2014, Judge Callie V.S. Grande awarded summary judgment to the plaintiff, denying both defendants’ requests for summary judgment as well as SafetyNet’s request for indemnification and contribution against DHR. The judge found that, as a facility that provided residential treatment for individuals with mental illness and other disabilities, PAIMI, PADD, and PAIR applied to SafetyNet Academy. Rejecting defendants’ assertion that individuals with moderate mental illness may be excluded from P&A protection, she emphasized that the protections offered by these laws were intended to be broad in scope and did not define P&A access “one resident at a time.” Accordingly, Judge Grande held that ADAP was authorized to monitor all SafetyNet Academy programs and must be allowed reasonable access by law and awarded declaratory and permanent injunctive relief to the plaintiff. She also ordered ADAP and SafetyNet to meet and prepare a protocol for ADAP’s monitoring and investigation visits. Finally, the order denied SafetyNet’s request for indemnification against DHR and held that each party should bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs. 65 F.Supp.3d 1312.</p><p>The parties met and submitted access protocol on January 30, 2015. In addition to describing ADAP’s scope of access to SafetyNet and its records, the protocol outlined procedures ADAP may follow should SafetyNet deny or delay access to its facilities in the future. </p><p>Also following the grant of summary judgment, ADAP submitted a motion for reconsideration of the court’s denial of attorneys’ fees and costs. On February 11, 2015, Judge Grande issued an order awarding the plaintiff filing fees as the prevailing party. However, the order denied the plaintiff attorneys’ fees, citing a failure to raise an applicable exception to the American Rule stating that litigants are generally expected to bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs. 2015 WL 566946.</p>",

              "transformed_text": "The story of the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program (ADAP) against SafetyNet Youthcare, Inc. began on October 25, 2013, when ADAP, serving as Alabama’s designated advocate for people with disabilities, brought a lawsuit. They felt compelled to act because SafetyNet, which operated SafetyNet Academy for male youths with emotional or behavioral disabilities, had repeatedly refused ADAP access to monitor its facilities, particularly its \"Moderate Program.\" ADAP believed this denial was unlawful under federal laws designed to protect individuals with mental illness and disabilities, and they sought court intervention to compel SafetyNet to open its doors for monitoring and investigation.\n\nSafetyNet responded on December 2, 2013, not only by denying ADAP's right to access its \"Moderate Program\" but also by seeking to shift potential blame. They brought in the Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR), arguing that if they had violated any laws, it was because DHR, their licensing authority, had advised them. This move was a strategic attempt to secure indemnification and protect themselves from any financial repercussions.\n\nAs a settlement proved elusive, the parties moved towards a definitive legal resolution. On September 19, 2014, all three parties sought summary judgment, each hoping the court would rule in their favor without the need for a full trial. ADAP maintained its position that it had a right to access all of SafetyNet Academy’s programs, while SafetyNet and DHR argued that individuals with \"moderate\" mental illness were not covered by the protective statutes, thereby justifying their denial of access.\n\nThe federal government, through the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), weighed in on October 14, 2014, lending significant support to ADAP's cause. The DOJ asserted that SafetyNet Academy's facilities clearly fell under federal regulations, reinforcing the argument that ADAP must be granted broad, unrestricted access. This intervention aimed to bolster ADAP's position and guide the court toward a ruling that upheld the spirit of the disability rights laws.\n\nUltimately, on December 12, 2014, Judge Callie V.S. Grande delivered a decisive judgment in favor of ADAP. She determined that the federal protection and advocacy laws broadly applied to SafetyNet Academy, rejecting the defendants' narrow interpretation that excluded individuals with \"moderate\" mental illness. Her ruling affirmed ADAP's authority to monitor all programs and mandated reasonable access, thereby enforcing the protective intent of the laws. The judge also dismissed SafetyNet's attempt to place responsibility on DHR, ensuring SafetyNet bore the full legal consequence of its actions. As a result, ADAP and SafetyNet were ordered to establish a clear protocol for future monitoring visits, ensuring compliance.\n\nFollowing this significant victory, ADAP sought to recover its legal costs. While the court granted filing fees on February 11, 2015, it denied attorneys' fees, adhering to the general principle that litigants typically bear their own legal expenses unless a specific exception applies.",

The Act was one of six statutes billed as the &ldquo;nation-leading legislative package to protect abortion and reproductive rights&rdquo; by New York Governor Kathy Hochul. It authorized the state Commissioner of Health to conduct a study and issue a report examining the unmet health and resource needs facing pregnant women in New York.</p>\r\n<p>The Sisters of Life, a Roman Catholic order of religious sisters located in New York, New York, filed this lawsuit against the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health on September 2, 2022. The Sisters of Life operate a crisis pregnancy center offering resources for pregnant women at their Visitation Mission in lower Manhattan. They claimed that the Act imposed intrusive and burdensome disclosure requirements, enforced by financial penalties, in violation of the First Amendment's Establishment Clause as well as the First Amendment rights to free speech, free exercise, assembly, and association in addition to the Fourth Amendment&rsquo;s protection against unreasonable search and seizure. Sisters of Life requested that the Court declare the Act unconstitutional on its face and as it applied, and sought a permanent injunction prohibiting enforcement, as well as attorney&rsquo;s fees and costs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 16, 2022, Sisters of Life filed a motion for a preliminary injunction that would enjoin enforcement of the Act during the litigation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 7, 2022, the parties filed a joint request to stay the litigation while they continued to discuss scheduling matters. The Court agreed to stay the litigation until January 10, 2023. On January 18, 2023 this stay was extended until April 17, 2023 after the parties jointly filed requesting an extension of the stay period. The New York State Department of Health advised that it was continuing to make progress on implementation of the statute and needed more time to determine the scope and timing of information requests under the statute. The parties agreed that in light of this, an extension of the stay period was the most efficient course of action for the parties and for the Court.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 27, 2023 the case was reassigned to Judge Jennifer H. Rearden. The stay period was extended multiple times.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On November 3, 2023 the parties submitted to the court a proposed Stipulation and Order of Settlement. On November 8, 2023 the order of settlement was stipulated and agreed to. The parties agreed, and Court approved, that all claims asserted by Plaintiff were to be dismissed, with prejudice and without payments, attorney's fees, costs, disbursements, or expenses, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a). Each party agreed to bear their own attorney's fees and costs. Defendant agreed not to take any enforcement action of any kind against Plaintiff based on Plaintiff's nonresponse to or noncompliance with any survey, document request, or information request of any kind authorized by or issued by Defendant pursuant to the statute. Per the agreement, the court was to retain jurisdiction until the Defendant's authority to request data ended via the publication of he report. Judge Rearden directed that the case be closed.&nbsp;</p>",

              "transformed_text": "Imagine your state government passes a new law. In June 2022, New York State passed a law (called Assembly Bill A5499/Senate Bill S470). Governor Kathy Hochul said this law was part of a big effort to protect the rights of women to make choices about their bodies and pregnancies. This law gave the head of the state's health department the power to look into what pregnant women in New York needed and weren't getting.\n\nNow, imagine a group disagrees with a law. On September 2, 2022, a Catholic religious group called the Sisters of Life, located in New York City, sued the head of the New York State Department of Health. The Sisters of Life run a center in Manhattan that helps pregnant women in difficult situations. They argued that the new law made them share too much private information, and they could be fined if they didn't. They said this went against their basic rights under the First Amendment, like freedom to speak, practice their religion, gather, and join groups. They also said it violated the First Amendment's rule that stops the government from favoring one religion. Plus, they claimed it went against their Fourth Amendment protection against unfair searches. The Sisters of Life asked the court to say the law was illegal and to permanently stop it from being used. They also wanted the state to pay their legal fees.\n\nOn September 16, 2022, the Sisters of Life went back to court. They asked for a \"preliminary injunction.\" Think of this like hitting a \"pause button\" on the law. If granted, this temporary order would have stopped the law from being used while the lawsuit was still happening.\n\nOn October 7, 2022, both sides in the lawsuit asked the court to put the case on hold while they talked about how to move forward. The court agreed to pause the case until January 10, 2023. This pause was extended again until April 17, 2023, after both groups asked for more time on January 18, 2023. The New York State Department of Health said it was still figuring out how to put the law into action. They needed more time to decide what information to ask for and when. Both sides agreed that pausing the case further was the smartest way to proceed for everyone, including the court.\n\nOn January 27, 2023, the case was given to a new judge, Judge Jennifer H. Rearden. The \"pause button\" on the case was pressed several more times after that.\n\nFinally, on November 3, 2023, both sides showed the court a proposed agreement to settle the case. The court approved this agreement on November 8, 2023. Both sides agreed, and the court approved, that all the complaints made by the Sisters of Life would be permanently dropped. No money would be exchanged between them, and each side would pay their own legal fees and costs, which is common in court cases. The State also agreed not to do anything against the Sisters of Life if they didn't respond to or follow any requests for information from the law. The agreement also stated that the court would keep some authority over the case until the State's power to ask for data ended when the required report was finished and published. After that, Judge Rearden ordered the case officially closed.",

Governor Kathy Hochul said this law would help protect women's rights to make choices about their bodies. The law let the state's health leader study what pregnant women in New York needed.\n\nNow, imagine a group disagrees with a law. On September 2, 2022, a Catholic religious group called the Sisters of Life sued the state's health leader. This group is in New York City. The Sisters of Life help pregnant women. They have a center in Manhattan. They said the new law made them share private information. They could get in trouble if they didn't. They said this went against their basic rights. These rights are in the First Amendment. They include freedom to speak, practice their religion, gather, and join groups. They also said the law broke a rule. This rule stops the government from picking one religion over others. They also said it went against their right to be safe from unfair searches. This right is in the Fourth Amendment. The Sisters of Life asked the court to say the law was wrong. They wanted it stopped for good. They also wanted the state to pay for their lawyers.\n\nOn September 16, 2022, the Sisters of Life went back to court. They asked for a \"temporary stop\" to the law. This would be like hitting a \"pause button\" on the law. If the court agreed, the law would stop while the case was still going on.\n\nOn October 7, 2022, both sides asked the court to pause the case. They wanted to talk about what to do next. The court agreed to pause the case until January 10, 2023. They asked for more time on January 18, 2023. So the pause lasted until April 17, 2023. The state's health leader said they were still figuring out how to use the law. They needed more time to decide what information to ask for. Both sides agreed that pausing the case longer was the best idea for everyone.\n\nOn January 27, 2023, a new judge took over the case. Her name was Judge Jennifer H. Rearden. The case was paused many more times after that.\n\nFinally, on November 3, 2023, both sides showed the court a plan to end the case. The court approved this plan on November 8, 2023. Both sides agreed to drop all the complaints made by the Sisters of Life. The court agreed too. No money changed hands. Each side paid for their own lawyers. This is normal in court cases. The State also agreed not to punish the Sisters of Life. This was if they didn't answer questions or follow requests from the law. The agreement said the court would still watch over the case. This would last until the state finished its report and stopped asking for information. After that, Judge Rearden said the case was officially over.",

The Act was one of six statutes billed as the &ldquo;nation-leading legislative package to protect abortion and reproductive rights&rdquo; by New York Governor Kathy Hochul. It authorized the state Commissioner of Health to conduct a study and issue a report examining the unmet health and resource needs facing pregnant women in New York.</p>\r\n<p>The Sisters of Life, a Roman Catholic order of religious sisters located in New York, New York, filed this lawsuit against the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health on September 2, 2022. The Sisters of Life operate a crisis pregnancy center offering resources for pregnant women at their Visitation Mission in lower Manhattan. They claimed that the Act imposed intrusive and burdensome disclosure requirements, enforced by financial penalties, in violation of the First Amendment's Establishment Clause as well as the First Amendment rights to free speech, free exercise, assembly, and association in addition to the Fourth Amendment&rsquo;s protection against unreasonable search and seizure. Sisters of Life requested that the Court declare the Act unconstitutional on its face and as it applied, and sought a permanent injunction prohibiting enforcement, as well as attorney&rsquo;s fees and costs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 16, 2022, Sisters of Life filed a motion for a preliminary injunction that would enjoin enforcement of the Act during the litigation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 7, 2022, the parties filed a joint request to stay the litigation while they continued to discuss scheduling matters. The Court agreed to stay the litigation until January 10, 2023. On January 18, 2023 this stay was extended until April 17, 2023 after the parties jointly filed requesting an extension of the stay period. The New York State Department of Health advised that it was continuing to make progress on implementation of the statute and needed more time to determine the scope and timing of information requests under the statute. The parties agreed that in light of this, an extension of the stay period was the most efficient course of action for the parties and for the Court.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 27, 2023 the case was reassigned to Judge Jennifer H.

On November 8, 2023 the order of settlement was stipulated and agreed to. The parties agreed, and Court approved, that all claims asserted by Plaintiff were to be dismissed, with prejudice and without payments, attorney's fees, costs, disbursements, or expenses, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a). Each party agreed to bear their own attorney's fees and costs. Defendant agreed not to take any enforcement action of any kind against Plaintiff based on Plaintiff's nonresponse to or noncompliance with any survey, document request, or information request of any kind authorized by or issued by Defendant pursuant to the statute. Per the agreement, the court was to retain jurisdiction until the Defendant's authority to request data ended via the publication of he report. Judge Rearden directed that the case be closed.&nbsp;</p>",

              "transformed_text": "In the legislative landscape of New York State, Assembly Bill A5499/Senate Bill S470, enacted in June 2022, emerged as a cornerstone of Governor Kathy Hochul's \"nation-leading legislative package to protect abortion and reproductive rights.\" This Act empowered the state Commissioner of Health to undertake a study and issue a report on the unmet health and resource needs of pregnant women across New York.\n\nHowever, this legislative endeavor soon faced a significant challenge. The Sisters of Life, a Roman Catholic order operating a crisis pregnancy center in lower Manhattan, perceived the Act as an intrusive imposition. Believing that its disclosure requirements, enforced by financial penalties, violated their fundamental First Amendment rights—including freedom of speech, religion, assembly, and association—as well as their Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search, they initiated a lawsuit against the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health on September 2, 2022. Their strategic purpose in filing this case was to have the Act declared unconstitutional and to secure a permanent injunction preventing its enforcement, thereby safeguarding their mission and principles from what they viewed as governmental overreach.\n\nTo prevent the Act from causing immediate harm while the legal proceedings unfolded, the Sisters of Life swiftly moved for a preliminary injunction on September 16, 2022. This procedural step was a strategic effort to halt the Act's enforcement during the litigation, ensuring their operations could continue unhindered.\n\nAs the case progressed, both parties recognized the value of a temporary cessation in the legal battle. On October 7, 2022, they jointly requested a stay in the litigation, which was granted and subsequently extended multiple times. This period of pause allowed the New York State Department of Health more time to clarify the Act's implementation and the precise scope and timing of its information requests. For both sides, this was a strategic decision to explore avenues for resolution outside of active court proceedings, aiming for a more efficient outcome. During this period, the case was reassigned to Judge Jennifer H. Rearden.\n\nUltimately, the parties found common ground, leading to a proposed Stipulation and Order of Settlement on November 3, 2023, which was formally approved days later. This settlement represented a mutually agreed-upon resolution: while the Sisters of Life's claims were formally dismissed, the state committed not to take any enforcement action against them based on their non-response or non-compliance with any surveys or information requests authorized by the statute. This strategic compromise allowed the Sisters of Life to continue their work free from the feared penalties, effectively achieving their core objective of protection against the Act's perceived overreach, and thus bringing the dispute to a close. The court retained jurisdiction until the report's publication concluded the defendant's data request authority, after which the case was closed.",

New York State had enacted a new law, Assembly Bill A5499/Senate Bill S470, which authorized surveys and information requests about pregnant women's health needs. The Sisters felt this law, with its potential financial penalties, would force them to compromise their deeply held beliefs and interfere with their ability to freely speak, practice their faith, gather, and associate, while also feeling like an invasion of their privacy. Their mission to serve was at risk.\n\nDetermined to protect their calling and their fundamental freedoms, the Sisters turned to the legal system for help.\n\nAfter a period of discussion, the Sisters and the state reached an understanding. The state agreed it would not penalize the Sisters for not participating in the surveys or requests outlined in the law. This outcome meant the Sisters could continue their vital work, supporting pregnant women without fear of fines or interference, and without having to pay any legal costs or fees to the state. All their initial concerns were put to rest, securing their freedom to serve.",

        "summary": "<p>On August 29, 2005, seven low-income Missouri residents who received health coverage through Medicaid filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri. The plaintiffs sued the State of Missouri under the Medicaid Act, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1983 and the Supremacy Clause. The plaintiffs, represented by an array of public interest organizations, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, asking the court to enjoin Missouri from enforcing an emergency Medicaid regulation that would deny plaintiffs access to durable medical equipment (DME). The plaintiffs claimed that the emergency regulation, eliminating coverage of DME for most categorically-needy Medicaid recipients in the state, violated the Medicaid Act's comparability requirements and reasonable standards provisions.  </p><p>As background, DME includes a wide variety of medical devices and equipment, including wheelchairs, prosthetics, orthopedic devices and hospital beds. Before 2005, Missouri provided DME as a stand-alone benefit to all recipients of Medicaid in the state. However, due to budget constraints, Missouri eliminated coverage of DME except for residents who are needy children, blind, or pregnant. In September 2005, the state promulgated an emergency regulation that reinstated coverage of certain DME items for all Medicaid recipients -- while at the same time extended coverage of additional items only to recipients who are blind, pregnant, needy children or those receiving home health care. The plaintiffs, who did not fall into those categories, were unable to obtain coverage for previously covered DME. Rather than challenging the statute, the plaintiffs argued that the emergency regulation impermissibly extended DME coverage to blind recipients but not others -- in violation of federal law. </p><p>On September 13, 2005, the court (Judge Whipple) denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. In evaluating the plaintiff's argument, Judge Whipple reasoned that the Missouri emergency regulations likely did not violate the comparability requirement of the Medicaid Act. Judge Whipple concluded that the plaintiffs had other ways of obtaining DME through the state's Medicaid program. Further, he noted that Missouri had filed for a waiver from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to permit it to provide DME services to the blind (but not other categorically need persons such as the plaintiffs). The plaintiffs appealed the District Court's decision to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.  </p><p>On June 22, 2006, the Eighth Circuit (Judge Benton) vacated and remanded the District Court's decision, finding that the state DME regulation was likely preempted by the Supremacy Clause. (Lankford v. Sherman, 451 F.3d 496 (8th Cir. 2006)). The Eighth Circuit determined, in line with the District Court's conclusion, that Missouri's provision of DME did not violate the Medicaid Act's comparability requirement. After HHS/CMS denied the waiver, Missouri decided to cover DME for the blind using solely state (and no federal) funds, meaning that it need not comply with the federal requirement. For the same reasons, the court concluded that the provision of DME services did not violate the reasonable standards requirement. The court further concluded that the plaintiffs did not have a private right of action under 1983 to enforce Medicaid's reasonable-standards provision. </p><p>The Eighth Circuit concluded that Missouri's DME regulations conflicted with the federal regulations that implement Medicaid's reasonable-standards requirement; thus, the regulations violated the Supremacy Clause. The plaintiffs had argued that the state regulation was unreasonable because it failed to provide sufficient DME services to meet Medicaid's basic objectives and the state's proposed alternatives to obtain the necessary DME were insufficient. The court agreed, concluding that the plaintiffs established a likelihood that they would prevail on the merits of their preemption claim pertaining to the reasonable-standards requirement. The court explained that because likelihood of success on the merits is only one of the four factors in determining whether to grant a preliminary injunction and the district court failed to address the other facts, the case should be remanded. </p><p>On March 2, 2007, Judge Whipple, on remand, granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and for a preliminary injunction to enjoin enforcement of Missouri's emergency Medicaid regulations that essentially eliminated the plaintiffs' access through Medicaid of DME. Judge Whipple ordered the state to amend its current DME program to comply with Medicaid's reasonable-standards requirement, thus remedying the preemption problem that the Eighth Circuit found. </p><p>On June 1, 2008, the defendants informed the court that on May 18, 2007, the Missouri General Assembly had passed a bill that covered all medically necessary DME. As such, defendants asked the court to declare that they were in compliance with the court's March 2 order. </p><p>On January 23, 2008, Judge Whipple declared that the defendants were in compliance with that order. He noted, however, that the only issue before the court was the legality of Missouri's 2005 emergency regulations. By eliminating that proposed regulatory scheme, Missouri complied with the order. However, the court was not deciding whether the state's subsequent legislative action in May 2007 conformed with the reasonable-standards requirement. </p><p>Because Judge Whipple found the defendants in compliance with the March 2, 2007 order, the case is closed. </p><p></p>",

              "transformed_text": "On August 29, 2005, seven low-income Missouri Medicaid recipients filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri against the State of Missouri under the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and the Supremacy Clause. Represented by public interest organizations, plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin enforcement of an emergency Medicaid regulation that denied them access to durable medical equipment (DME). They asserted the regulation, which eliminated DME coverage for most categorically-needy Medicaid recipients, violated the Medicaid Act's comparability requirements and reasonable standards provisions.\n\nDME encompasses various medical devices and equipment, such as wheelchairs, prosthetics, orthopedic devices, and hospital beds. Prior to 2005, Missouri provided DME as a stand-alone benefit to all Medicaid recipients. Due to budget constraints, Missouri eliminated DME coverage except for needy children, blind, or pregnant residents. In September 2005, the state promulgated an emergency regulation reinstating coverage of certain DME items for all Medicaid recipients, while extending additional items only to those who are blind, pregnant, needy children, or receiving home health care. Plaintiffs, not falling into these categories, were unable to obtain coverage for previously covered DME. They argued the emergency regulation impermissibly extended DME coverage to blind recipients but not others, violating federal law, rather than challenging the underlying statute.\n\nOn September 13, 2005, Judge Whipple denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The court reasoned that Missouri's emergency regulations likely did not violate the Medicaid Act's comparability requirement, concluding plaintiffs had alternative avenues for obtaining DME. Judge Whipple also noted Missouri had sought a waiver from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to provide DME services to the blind, excluding other categorically needy persons like the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs appealed to the Eighth Circuit.\n\nOn June 22, 2006, the Eighth Circuit (Judge Benton) vacated and remanded the District Court's decision, finding the state DME regulation was likely preempted by the Supremacy Clause. (Lankford v. Sherman, 451 F.3d 496 (8th Cir. 2006)). The Eighth Circuit affirmed the District Court's conclusion that Missouri's DME provision did not violate the Medicaid Act's comparability requirement. After HHS/CMS denied the waiver, Missouri opted to cover DME for the blind using solely state funds, thereby avoiding federal compliance requirements. The court also held plaintiffs lacked a private right of action under § 1983 to enforce Medicaid's reasonable-standards provision.\n\nThe Eighth Circuit concluded that Missouri's DME regulations conflicted with federal regulations implementing Medicaid's reasonable-standards requirement, thus violating the Supremacy Clause. Plaintiffs had argued the state regulation was unreasonable, failing to provide sufficient DME services to meet Medicaid's basic objectives, and that proposed state alternatives were insufficient. The court agreed, finding plaintiffs established a likelihood of prevailing on their preemption claim regarding the reasonable-standards requirement. The case was remanded because the likelihood of success on the merits is only one of four factors for a preliminary injunction, and the district court failed to address the others.\n\nOn March 2, 2007, on remand, Judge Whipple granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and a preliminary injunction, enjoining enforcement of Missouri's emergency Medicaid regulations that eliminated plaintiffs' Medicaid access to DME. The court ordered the state to amend its DME program to comply with Medicaid's reasonable-standards requirement, remedying the preemption issue identified by the Eighth Circuit.\n\nOn June 1, 2008, defendants informed the court that the Missouri General Assembly had passed a bill on May 18, 2007, covering all medically necessary DME, and sought a declaration of compliance with the court's March 2 order.\n\nOn January 23, 2008, Judge Whipple declared defendants in compliance with the March 2, 2007 order. He noted the only issue before the court was the legality of Missouri's 2005 emergency regulations, and by eliminating that proposed regulatory scheme, Missouri complied. However, the court was not deciding whether the state's subsequent legislative action in May 2007 conformed with the reasonable-standards requirement.\n\nBecause Judge Whipple found the defendants in compliance with the March 2, 2007 order, the case is closed.",

The plaintiffs sued the State of Missouri under the Medicaid Act, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1983 and the Supremacy Clause. The plaintiffs, represented by an array of public interest organizations, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, asking the court to enjoin Missouri from enforcing an emergency Medicaid regulation that would deny plaintiffs access to durable medical equipment (DME). The plaintiffs claimed that the emergency regulation, eliminating coverage of DME for most categorically-needy Medicaid recipients in the state, violated the Medicaid Act's comparability requirements and reasonable standards provisions.  </p><p>As background, DME includes a wide variety of medical devices and equipment, including wheelchairs, prosthetics, orthopedic devices and hospital beds. Before 2005, Missouri provided DME as a stand-alone benefit to all recipients of Medicaid in the state. However, due to budget constraints, Missouri eliminated coverage of DME except for residents who are needy children, blind, or pregnant. In September 2005, the state promulgated an emergency regulation that reinstated coverage of certain DME items for all Medicaid recipients -- while at the same time extended coverage of additional items only to recipients who are blind, pregnant, needy children or those receiving home health care. The plaintiffs, who did not fall into those categories, were unable to obtain coverage for previously covered DME. Rather than challenging the statute, the plaintiffs argued that the emergency regulation impermissibly extended DME coverage to blind recipients but not others -- in violation of federal law. </p><p>On September 13, 2005, the court (Judge Whipple) denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. In evaluating the plaintiff's argument, Judge Whipple reasoned that the Missouri emergency regulations likely did not violate the comparability requirement of the Medicaid Act. Judge Whipple concluded that the plaintiffs had other ways of obtaining DME through the state's Medicaid program. Further, he noted that Missouri had filed for a waiver from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to permit it to provide DME services to the blind (but not other categorically need persons such as the plaintiffs). The plaintiffs appealed the District Court's decision to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.  </p><p>On June 22, 2006, the Eighth Circuit (Judge Benton) vacated and remanded the District Court's decision, finding that the state DME regulation was likely preempted by the Supremacy Clause. (Lankford v. Sherman, 451 F.3d 496 (8th Cir. 2006)). The Eighth Circuit determined, in line with the District Court's conclusion, that Missouri's provision of DME did not violate the Medicaid Act's comparability requirement. After HHS/CMS denied the waiver, Missouri decided to cover DME for the blind using solely state (and no federal) funds, meaning that it need not comply with the federal requirement. For the same reasons, the court concluded that the provision of DME services did not violate the reasonable standards requirement. The court further concluded that the plaintiffs did not have a private right of action under 1983 to enforce Medicaid's reasonable-standards provision. </p><p>The Eighth Circuit concluded that Missouri's DME regulations conflicted with the federal regulations that implement Medicaid's reasonable-standards requirement; thus, the regulations violated the Supremacy Clause. The plaintiffs had argued that the state regulation was unreasonable because it failed to provide sufficient DME services to meet Medicaid's basic objectives and the state's proposed alternatives to obtain the necessary DME were insufficient. The court agreed, concluding that the plaintiffs established a likelihood that they would prevail on the merits of their preemption claim pertaining to the reasonable-standards requirement. The court explained that because likelihood of success on the merits is only one of the four factors in determining whether to grant a preliminary injunction and the district court failed to address the other facts, the case should be remanded. </p><p>On March 2, 2007, Judge Whipple, on remand, granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and for a preliminary injunction to enjoin enforcement of Missouri's emergency Medicaid regulations that essentially eliminated the plaintiffs' access through Medicaid of DME. Judge Whipple ordered the state to amend its current DME program to comply with Medicaid's reasonable-standards requirement, thus remedying the preemption problem that the Eighth Circuit found. </p><p>On June 1, 2008, the defendants informed the court that on May 18, 2007, the Missouri General Assembly had passed a bill that covered all medically necessary DME. As such, defendants asked the court to declare that they were in compliance with the court's March 2 order. </p><p>On January 23, 2008, Judge Whipple declared that the defendants were in compliance with that order. He noted, however, that the only issue before the court was the legality of Missouri's 2005 emergency regulations. By eliminating that proposed regulatory scheme, Missouri complied with the order. However, the court was not deciding whether the state's subsequent legislative action in May 2007 conformed with the reasonable-standards requirement. </p><p>Because Judge Whipple found the defendants in compliance with the March 2, 2007 order, the case is closed. </p><p></p>",

              "transformed_text": "On August 29, 2005, seven low-income Missouri residents on Medicaid filed a lawsuit in a federal court in Missouri. They sued the State of Missouri, arguing that a state rule violated the federal Medicaid Act and the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause. These plaintiffs, represented by public interest groups, asked the court to declare the rule illegal and to stop Missouri from enforcing an emergency Medicaid rule. This rule would have prevented them from getting durable medical equipment (DME). They argued that this emergency rule, which cut off DME coverage for most low-income Medicaid recipients, went against the Medicaid Act's rules about 'comparability' and 'reasonable standards'.\n\nDME includes many medical devices and equipment, like wheelchairs, prosthetics, and hospital beds. Before 2005, Missouri covered DME for all Medicaid recipients. But because of budget problems, Missouri stopped covering DME for most people, except for needy children, the blind, or pregnant individuals. In September 2005, the state issued an emergency rule. This rule brought back coverage for some DME items for all Medicaid recipients. However, it only added coverage for *more* items for those who were blind, pregnant, needy children, or getting home health care. The plaintiffs, who didn't fit these specific groups, could no longer get DME that used to be covered. Instead of challenging the law itself, the plaintiffs argued that the emergency rule wrongly gave DME coverage to blind recipients but not others, which violated federal law.\n\nOn September 13, 2005, the court (Judge Whipple) denied the plaintiffs' request to temporarily stop the rule. Judge Whipple thought Missouri's emergency rules probably did not violate the Medicaid Act's 'comparability' rule. He concluded that the plaintiffs could likely get DME through other parts of Missouri's Medicaid program. He also noted that Missouri had asked the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for permission to provide DME to the blind, but not to others like the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs appealed this decision to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nOn June 22, 2006, the Eighth Circuit (Judge Benton) overturned the lower court's decision and sent the case back. The appeals court found that the state's DME rule was likely overridden by the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause. The Eighth Circuit agreed with the lower court that Missouri's DME coverage did not violate the Medicaid Act's 'comparability' rule. After HHS/CMS denied the waiver, Missouri decided to pay for DME for the blind using only state money, not federal funds. This meant it didn't have to follow the federal rule for that specific group. For similar reasons, the court also found that the DME services did not violate the 'reasonable standards' rule. The court also decided that the plaintiffs could not directly sue under Section 1983 to enforce Medicaid's 'reasonable standards' rule.\n\nHowever, the Eighth Circuit concluded that Missouri's DME rules conflicted with federal rules that put Medicaid's 'reasonable standards' requirement into practice. Therefore, the state rules violated the Supremacy Clause. The plaintiffs had argued that the state rule was unreasonable. They said it didn't provide enough DME services to meet Medicaid's basic goals, and the state's suggested alternative ways to get DME were not good enough. The court agreed, finding that the plaintiffs were likely to win their argument that the state rule was overridden by federal law regarding the 'reasonable standards' requirement. The court explained that since 'likelihood of success on the merits' is just one of four factors for granting a temporary stop order, and the lower court hadn't looked at the other factors, the case needed to be sent back.\n\nOn March 2, 2007, Judge Whipple, after getting the case back, ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. He also issued a temporary order to stop Missouri from enforcing its emergency Medicaid rules that had largely cut off the plaintiffs' access to DME through Medicaid. Judge Whipple ordered the state to change its DME program to meet Medicaid's 'reasonable standards' rule, fixing the issue that the Eighth Circuit found was overridden by federal law.\n\nOn June 1, 2008, the state (the defendants) told the court that on May 18, 2007, the Missouri legislature had passed a new law. This law covered all medically necessary DME. Because of this, the state asked the court to declare that they were following the court's March 2 order.\n\nOn January 23, 2008, Judge Whipple declared that the state was following that order. However, he pointed out that the only thing the court was looking at was whether Missouri's 2005 emergency rules were legal. By getting rid of that proposed set of rules, Missouri obeyed the order. But the court was not deciding if the state's new law from May 2007 met the 'reasonable standards' rule.\n\nSince Judge Whipple found the state was following the March 2, 2007 order, the case was closed.",

              "transformed_text": "On August 29, 2005, seven low-income Missouri residents on Medicaid filed a lawsuit in a federal court in Missouri. They sued the State of Missouri, saying a state rule went against federal law, specifically the federal Medicaid Act and a part of the U.S. Constitution called the Supremacy Clause. Think of the Supremacy Clause like this: if a state law and a federal law disagree, the federal law wins. It's like the federal government's rules are the 'supreme' ones. These residents, with help from groups that work for the public good, asked the court to say the rule was illegal and stop Missouri from using an emergency Medicaid rule. This rule would have stopped them from getting important medical equipment, like wheelchairs or hospital beds, which we'll call DME from now on. They argued this emergency rule, which stopped most low-income Medicaid users from getting DME, went against the federal Medicaid law's rules. These rules say that states must offer 'comparable' benefits (meaning similar benefits for similar groups of people) and meet 'reasonable standards' (meaning they must provide enough benefits).\n\nDME includes many medical devices and equipment, like wheelchairs, prosthetics (artificial limbs), and hospital beds. Before 2005, Missouri paid for DME for everyone on Medicaid. But because of money problems, Missouri stopped paying for DME for most people. Only certain groups, like children in need, people who are blind, or pregnant individuals, could still get it. In September 2005, the state put out an emergency rule. This new rule brought back *some* DME coverage for everyone on Medicaid. But it offered *more* items only to those who were blind, pregnant, needy children, or getting care at home. The people who sued didn't fit into these special groups. So, they couldn't get DME that they used to be able to get. Instead of arguing against the law itself, the plaintiffs said that the emergency rule was wrong because it gave DME to blind people but not to others like them, which they said broke federal law.\n\nOn September 13, 2005, the court, led by Judge Whipple, said 'no' to the plaintiffs' request for a temporary order to stop the rule. Judge Whipple thought Missouri's emergency rules probably didn't break the Medicaid law's 'comparability' rule (the one about similar benefits for similar groups). He believed the plaintiffs could likely get DME through other parts of Missouri's Medicaid program. He also pointed out that Missouri had asked federal agencies (like the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS) for a special permission, called a 'waiver,' to give DME to blind people but not to others like the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs didn't give up; they appealed this decision to a higher court, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nOn June 22, 2006, the Eighth Circuit Court, with Judge Benton in charge, overturned the lower court's decision and sent the case back for another look. The appeals court decided that the state's DME rule was likely overridden by the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause (remember, federal law wins). The Eighth Circuit agreed with the lower court that Missouri's DME coverage didn't break the Medicaid law's 'comparability' rule. After the federal agencies said 'no' to Missouri's special permission (waiver), Missouri decided to pay for DME for the blind using only its own state money, not federal money. This meant that for that specific group (the blind), Missouri didn't have to follow the federal rule. The court also found that the actual DME services Missouri provided didn't break the 'reasonable standards' rule (the one about providing enough benefits). And the court decided the plaintiffs couldn't directly sue under a specific federal law to make sure Medicaid's 'reasonable standards' rule was followed.\n\nHowever, the Eighth Circuit concluded that Missouri's DME *rules* themselves went against federal rules. These federal rules explain how the Medicaid law's 'reasonable standards' requirement should actually be used. So, the state rules broke the Supremacy Clause. The plaintiffs had argued that the state rule was unreasonable. They said it didn't provide enough DME services to meet Medicaid's main goals. They also said that the state's suggested other ways to get DME weren't good enough. The court agreed. It found the plaintiffs were likely to win their argument that the state rule was overridden by federal law when it came to the 'reasonable standards' requirement. The court explained that showing you're 'likely to win' is just one of four things a court looks at when deciding whether to issue a temporary stop order. Since the lower court hadn't looked at the other things, the case needed to be sent back again.\n\nOn March 2, 2007, Judge Whipple, after getting the case back, ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. He also issued a temporary order. This order stopped Missouri from using its emergency Medicaid rules. These rules had largely stopped the plaintiffs from getting DME through Medicaid. Judge Whipple ordered the state to change its DME program. It needed to meet Medicaid's 'reasonable standards' rule. This fixed the problem that the Eighth Circuit said was overridden by federal law.\n\nOn June 1, 2008, the state (the defendants in the case) told the court about a new law. The Missouri legislature (the state's lawmaking body) had passed this new law on May 18, 2007. This new law said it would cover all medically necessary DME. Because of this, the state asked the court to say they were now following the court's order from March 2.\n\nOn January 23, 2008, Judge Whipple said that the state *was* following that order. However, he pointed out that the court was only looking at whether Missouri's 2005 emergency rules were legal. By getting rid of that specific set of rules, Missouri obeyed the order. But the court was *not* deciding if the state's *new* law from May 2007 actually met the 'reasonable standards' rule.\n\nSince Judge Whipple found the state was following the March 2, 2007 order, the case was closed.",

              "transformed_text": "On August 29, 2005, seven people in Missouri filed a lawsuit. They were low-income and got health help from Medicaid. They sued the State of Missouri in a federal court. They said a state rule went against federal law. This included the federal Medicaid law and a part of the U.S. Constitution called the Supremacy Clause. This clause means federal law wins if it disagrees with state law. These people had help from groups that work for the public good. They asked the court to say the rule was illegal. They wanted Missouri to stop using an emergency Medicaid rule. This rule would have stopped them from getting important medical equipment. We will call this 'DME' from now on. They said this emergency rule was wrong. It stopped most low-income people on Medicaid from getting DME. They argued it went against federal Medicaid law. This law says states must offer 'comparable' benefits. That means similar benefits for similar groups. It also says states must meet 'reasonable standards'. That means providing enough benefits.\n\nDME is many types of medical equipment. This includes wheelchairs, artificial limbs, and hospital beds. Before 2005, Missouri paid for DME for everyone on Medicaid. But the state had money problems. So, Missouri stopped paying for DME for most people. Only certain groups could still get it. These included children in need, people who are blind, or pregnant people. In September 2005, the state made a new emergency rule. This rule brought back *some* DME coverage for everyone on Medicaid. But it gave *more* items only to those who were blind, pregnant, needy children, or getting care at home. The people who sued were not in these special groups. So, they could not get DME they used to get. They did not argue against the main law. Instead, they said the emergency rule was wrong. They said it gave DME to blind people but not to others like them. They said this broke federal law.\n\nOn September 13, 2005, the court said 'no' to the people who sued. Judge Whipple was in charge. They had asked for a temporary order to stop the rule. Judge Whipple thought Missouri's emergency rules probably did not break the Medicaid law's 'comparability' rule. This rule is about similar benefits for similar groups. He believed the people who sued could likely get DME in other ways. He also said that Missouri had asked federal agencies for special permission. This is called a 'waiver'. They wanted to give DME to blind people but not to others like the people who sued. The people who sued did not give up. They appealed this decision to a higher court. This was the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nOn June 22, 2006, the Eighth Circuit Court looked at the case again. Judge Benton was in charge. They overturned the lower court's decision. They sent the case back for another look. The appeals court decided that the state's DME rule was likely overridden by the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause. Remember, federal law wins. The Eighth Circuit agreed with the lower court. They said Missouri's DME coverage did not break the Medicaid law's 'comparability' rule. Later, the federal agencies said 'no' to Missouri's special permission (waiver). So, Missouri decided to pay for DME for the blind using only its own state money. They did not use federal money. This meant that for blind people, Missouri did not have to follow the federal rule. The court also found that the actual DME services Missouri provided did not break the 'reasonable standards' rule. This rule is about providing enough benefits. And the court decided the people who sued could not directly sue under a specific federal law to make sure Medicaid's 'reasonable standards' rule was followed.\n\nBut the Eighth Circuit said that Missouri's DME *rules* themselves went against federal rules. These federal rules explain how the Medicaid law's 'reasonable standards' rule should actually be used. So, the state rules broke the Supremacy Clause. The people who sued had said the state rule was not reasonable. They said it did not give enough DME services to meet Medicaid's main goals. They also said that the state's other ideas for getting DME were not good enough. The court agreed. It found the people who sued were likely to win their argument. They said the state rule was overridden by federal law when it came to the 'reasonable standards' rule. The court explained that showing you are 'likely to win' is just one of four things a court looks at. This is when a court decides whether to issue a temporary stop order. The lower court had not looked at the other things. So, the case needed to be sent back again.\n\nOn March 2, 2007, Judge Whipple got the case back. He ruled in favor of the people who sued. He also issued a temporary order. This order stopped Missouri from using its emergency Medicaid rules. These rules had mostly stopped the people who sued from getting DME through Medicaid. Judge Whipple told the state to change its DME program. It needed to meet Medicaid's 'reasonable standards' rule. This fixed the problem that the Eighth Circuit said was overridden by federal law.\n\nOn June 1, 2008, the state (who were sued) told the court about a new law. Missouri's lawmakers had passed this new law on May 18, 2007. This new law said it would pay for all medical equipment that was truly needed. Because of this, the state asked the court to say they were now following the court's order from March 2.\n\nOn January 23, 2008, Judge Whipple said that the state *was* following that order. But he pointed out that the court was only looking at whether Missouri's 2005 emergency rules were legal. By getting rid of those specific rules, Missouri obeyed the order. But the court was *not* deciding if the state's *new* law from May 2007 actually met the 'reasonable standards' rule.\n\nSince Judge Whipple found the state was following the order, the case was closed.",

              "text": "<p>On August 29, 2005, seven low-income Missouri residents who received health coverage through Medicaid filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri. The plaintiffs sued the State of Missouri under the Medicaid Act, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1983 and the Supremacy Clause. The plaintiffs, represented by an array of public interest organizations, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, asking the court to enjoin Missouri from enforcing an emergency Medicaid regulation that would deny plaintiffs access to durable medical equipment (DME). The plaintiffs claimed that the emergency regulation, eliminating coverage of DME for most categorically-needy Medicaid recipients in the state, violated the Medicaid Act's comparability requirements and reasonable standards provisions.  </p><p>As background, DME includes a wide variety of medical devices and equipment, including wheelchairs, prosthetics, orthopedic devices and hospital beds. Before 2005, Missouri provided DME as a stand-alone benefit to all recipients of Medicaid in the state. However, due to budget constraints, Missouri eliminated coverage of DME except for residents who are needy children, blind, or pregnant. In September 2005, the state promulgated an emergency regulation that reinstated coverage of certain DME items for all Medicaid recipients -- while at the same time extended coverage of additional items only to recipients who are blind, pregnant, needy children or those receiving home health care. The plaintiffs, who did not fall into those categories, were unable to obtain coverage for previously covered DME. Rather than challenging the statute, the plaintiffs argued that the emergency regulation impermissibly extended DME coverage to blind recipients but not others -- in violation of federal law. </p><p>On September 13, 2005, the court (Judge Whipple) denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. In evaluating the plaintiff's argument, Judge Whipple reasoned that the Missouri emergency regulations likely did not violate the comparability requirement of the Medicaid Act. Judge Whipple concluded that the plaintiffs had other ways of obtaining DME through the state's Medicaid program. Further, he noted that Missouri had filed for a waiver from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to permit it to provide DME services to the blind (but not other categorically need persons such as the plaintiffs). The plaintiffs appealed the District Court's decision to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.  </p><p>On June 22, 2006, the Eighth Circuit (Judge Benton) vacated and remanded the District Court's decision, finding that the state DME regulation was likely preempted by the Supremacy Clause. (Lankford v. Sherman, 451 F.3d 496 (8th Cir. 2006)). The Eighth Circuit determined, in line with the District Court's conclusion, that Missouri's provision of DME did not violate the Medicaid Act's comparability requirement. After HHS/CMS denied the waiver, Missouri decided to cover DME for the blind using solely state (and no federal) funds, meaning that it need not comply with the federal requirement. For the same reasons, the court concluded that the provision of DME services did not violate the reasonable standards requirement. The court further concluded that the plaintiffs did not have a private right of action under 1983 to enforce Medicaid's reasonable-standards provision. </p><p>The Eighth Circuit concluded that Missouri's DME regulations conflicted with the federal regulations that implement Medicaid's reasonable-standards requirement; thus, the regulations violated the Supremacy Clause. The plaintiffs had argued that the state regulation was unreasonable because it failed to provide sufficient DME services to meet Medicaid's basic objectives and the state's proposed alternatives to obtain the necessary DME were insufficient. The court agreed, concluding that the plaintiffs established a likelihood that they would prevail on the merits of their preemption claim pertaining to the reasonable-standards requirement. The court explained that because likelihood of success on the merits is only one of the four factors in determining whether to grant a preliminary injunction and the district court failed to address the other facts, the case should be remanded. </p><p>On March 2, 2007, Judge Whipple, on remand, granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and for a preliminary injunction to enjoin enforcement of Missouri's emergency Medicaid regulations that essentially eliminated the plaintiffs' access through Medicaid of DME. Judge Whipple ordered the state to amend its current DME program to comply with Medicaid's reasonable-standards requirement, thus remedying the preemption problem that the Eighth Circuit found. </p><p>On June 1, 2008, the defendants informed the court that on May 18, 2007, the Missouri General Assembly had passed a bill that covered all medically necessary DME. As such, defendants asked the court to declare that they were in compliance with the court's March 2 order. </p><p>On January 23, 2008, Judge Whipple declared that the defendants were in compliance with that order. He noted, however, that the only issue before the court was the legality of Missouri's 2005 emergency regulations. By eliminating that proposed regulatory scheme, Missouri complied with the order. However, the court was not deciding whether the state's subsequent legislative action in May 2007 conformed with the reasonable-standards requirement. </p><p>Because Judge Whipple found the defendants in compliance with the March 2, 2007 order, the case is closed. </p><p></p>",

              "transformed_text": "A legal battle began in August 2005 when seven low-income Missouri residents, relying on Medicaid for health coverage, sought to reclaim vital access to durable medical equipment (DME). They initiated a lawsuit against the State of Missouri, challenging an emergency Medicaid regulation that effectively cut off their access to essential items like wheelchairs and prosthetics. Their core argument was that this state regulation, born from budget constraints, violated federal Medicaid law, which mandates comparable and reasonable standards for coverage. They asked the court to intervene and prevent the state from enforcing a rule that left many vulnerable citizens without necessary medical devices.\n\nThe state, having previously provided DME broadly, had narrowed coverage significantly, only to reinstate some items while still excluding many, including the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs believed this selective coverage, particularly the extension of benefits to the blind but not other similarly needy individuals, was an impermissible violation of federal law.\n\nThe initial judicial assessment, however, did not favor the plaintiffs' immediate plea to halt the regulation. In September 2005, the district court denied their request for a preliminary injunction, a strategic move by the plaintiffs to quickly restore DME access. The court reasoned that Missouri's emergency regulations likely did not violate federal comparability requirements, suggesting other avenues for obtaining DME existed, and noted the state's ongoing efforts to secure a federal waiver for its new policy. This decision allowed the state's restrictive policy to continue.\n\nUndeterred, the plaintiffs carried their fight to a higher court. In June 2006, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals took up the case, aiming to correct what they saw as an error in the lower court's judgment. The appellate court agreed that the state's provision of DME did not violate the Medicaid Act's comparability requirement. However, it found a critical flaw: Missouri's emergency regulation was likely preempted by federal law under the Supremacy Clause, specifically conflicting with the \"reasonable standards\" requirement of Medicaid. This meant the state's attempt to limit DME, even if driven by budget concerns, was likely unlawful. The Eighth Circuit sent the case back, directing the lower court to reconsider the injunction in light of this significant finding.\n\nArmed with the appellate court's guidance, the plaintiffs successfully pressed their case on remand in March 2007. They sought summary judgment to definitively establish the illegality of the state's regulation without a full trial, and again requested a preliminary injunction to immediately halt its enforcement. The district court, now bound by the Eighth Circuit's interpretation, granted both. This ruling effectively enjoined Missouri from enforcing the emergency regulation, ordering the state to amend its DME program to comply with federal reasonable-standards requirements, thereby remedying the preemption issue identified by the appellate court.\n\nThe state's strategic response came in June 2008. To demonstrate compliance and bring the litigation to a close, Missouri informed the court that its General Assembly had passed new legislation covering all medically necessary DME. The state sought a declaration from the court that it had fulfilled its obligations under the March 2007 order. In January 2008, the court acknowledged the state's compliance, noting that the specific emergency regulations challenged in the lawsuit had been addressed. While the court did not rule on the broader legality of the state's new legislative action, it found that the original legal dispute over the 2005 emergency regulations had been resolved, thus closing the case.",

This outcome followed a challenge by seven Missouri residents who relied on Medicaid, after an emergency state regulation cut off their access to crucial items like wheelchairs and prosthetics. They argued this state policy, enacted due to budget constraints, violated federal Medicaid law's requirement for reasonable and comparable coverage standards.\n\nInitially, a court decision allowed the state's restrictive policy to continue, leaving many without necessary devices. However, a higher court intervened, recognizing that Missouri's emergency regulation directly conflicted with federal Medicaid requirements, specifically the \"reasonable standards\" mandate. This crucial finding meant the state's policy was likely invalid under federal law.\n\nFollowing this directive, the state was ultimately prevented from enforcing its restrictive regulation and was ordered to amend its DME program to comply with federal requirements. To resolve the matter and demonstrate compliance, the Missouri General Assembly subsequently passed new legislation ensuring coverage for all medically necessary DME. This action restored access to essential medical equipment for those who needed it, upholding the principle that states must meet federal standards in providing critical health services.",

        "summary": "<p>On May 4, 1990, the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division announced, in a letter to the Governor of Virginia, its intent to launch an investigation, pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1997 et seq., into conditions at the Northern Virginia Training Center (NVTC), an institution for individuals with developmental disabilities in Fairfax, Virginia. Five experts from the Department of Justice toured the facility, reviewed policies and procedures, interviewed NVTC staff, and audited reporting and investigation practices.</p>\r\n<p>On April 9, 1991, the Department of Justice announced its findings. The Department of Justice reported that the health and safety of people living at NVTC was at risk for a number of reasons. NVTC employed too few people and inadequately trained those it did employ, which placed residents in danger of unnecessary chexmical and physical restraint. Often mechanical restraints were accompanied by seclusion, which was a fire hazard. Individualized programming for residents was inadequate and recordkeeping deficiencies made it impossible to monitor an individual's progress. In addition, NVTC's medical care, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and medication and side effect monitoring we all inadequate. In addition, NVTC provided insufficient medical care, including medication monitoring and occupational therapy. Recordkeeping made it difficult to track the efficacy of individualized programming and medical care. In closing, the Department of Justice expressed the desire to negotiate a resolution.</p>\r\n<p>Negotiations did not make enough progress and, on May 31, 1994, the Department of Justice threatened to file a CRIPA lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of conditions at NVTC. In addition to its earlier concerns, the Department of Justice chronicled systematic abuse and neglect at NVTC. For instance, individualized training programs were so inadequate that individuals became seriously sick or died as the result of aggressive, pica, and other self-injurious behaviors. One resident asphyxiated on a rubber glove, while another ate a reported seven cigarettes and one feminine hygiene pad in the span of two days. Similarly, inappropriate feeding techniques and poor nutrition endangered residents' health.</p>\r\n<p>Virginia may have made an effort engage in productive negotiations, but the Department of Justice was not satisfied. On February 8, 1995, the Department of Justice notified the Governor of Virginia that, in addition to being unconstitutional, the conditions at NVTC violated the Americans With Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 12101 et seq., Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 794, the Social Security Act (\"Medicaid\"), 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1396 et seq., and Virginia law.</p>\r\n<p>On March 4, 1996, the Department of Justice filed a CRIPA lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, challenging conditions at NVTC. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to address (1) individualized programming, (2) undue physical restraint and isolation, (3) facility safety, (4) medical care, (5) physical and occupational therapy, (6) medication monitoring, especially for tardive dyskenesia, and (7) staff numbers and training.</p>\r\n<p>On May 21, 1996, the court (Judge Leonie M. Brinkema) refused to consolidate this lawsuit with United States v. Virginia, No. 96-284, <a href=\"../../../../case/427/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">U.S. v. Virginia</a>, an action challenging the constitutionality of conditions at a Virginia psychiatric hospital. On May 21, 1996, the court also granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, but stayed its ruling to allow for settlement. On July 18, 1996, the court approved a settlement agreement.</p>\r\n<p>The settlement agreement itself was mostly concerned with procedural elements, such as development of a plan for improvement, compliance deadlines, evaluation, and dismissal. The NVTC plan describes the required compliance. The plan emphasizes the importance of trained staff in the provision of developmental disability services. The plan stated detailed training requirements for direct care staff and incorporated training into almost every solution. For instance, the plan mandated the dismissal of employees who neglected or abused residents. Similarly, the plan sought to reduce the need for restraints by both improving staff development and requiring the interdisciplinary treatment teams' advance approval for the type of restraints to be used for each individual. Thus, both chemical restraints and draconian physical restraint techniques, such as papoose boards, were eliminated. Similar clauses addressed medical care, medication administration and tracking, physical and occupational therapy, abuse and injury reporting and investigations, recordkeeping, functional planning, community placement, and quality assurance.</p>\r\n<p>The parties modified the settlement on May 30, 1997. On August 29, 1997, the Department of Justice inspected NVTC and found it was in compliance with the plan. On June 3, 1998, the court dismissed the lawsuit.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

On April 9, 1991, the DOJ released their findings; people at NCTC were at risk because of inadequate training of staff and inappropriate chemical and physical restraints.  Negotiations were initiated, but broke down. On March 4, 1996 the DOJ filed a CIRPA lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.  On July 18, 1996, the parties entered a court approved settlement agreement in which NVTC agreed to better train their staff and reduce their need for restraints.

              "text": "<p>On May 4, 1990, the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division announced, in a letter to the Governor of Virginia, its intent to launch an investigation, pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1997 et seq., into conditions at the Northern Virginia Training Center (NVTC), an institution for individuals with developmental disabilities in Fairfax, Virginia. Five experts from the Department of Justice toured the facility, reviewed policies and procedures, interviewed NVTC staff, and audited reporting and investigation practices.</p>\r\n<p>On April 9, 1991, the Department of Justice announced its findings. The Department of Justice reported that the health and safety of people living at NVTC was at risk for a number of reasons. NVTC employed too few people and inadequately trained those it did employ, which placed residents in danger of unnecessary chexmical and physical restraint. Often mechanical restraints were accompanied by seclusion, which was a fire hazard. Individualized programming for residents was inadequate and recordkeeping deficiencies made it impossible to monitor an individual's progress. In addition, NVTC's medical care, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and medication and side effect monitoring we all inadequate. In addition, NVTC provided insufficient medical care, including medication monitoring and occupational therapy. Recordkeeping made it difficult to track the efficacy of individualized programming and medical care. In closing, the Department of Justice expressed the desire to negotiate a resolution.</p>\r\n<p>Negotiations did not make enough progress and, on May 31, 1994, the Department of Justice threatened to file a CRIPA lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of conditions at NVTC. In addition to its earlier concerns, the Department of Justice chronicled systematic abuse and neglect at NVTC. For instance, individualized training programs were so inadequate that individuals became seriously sick or died as the result of aggressive, pica, and other self-injurious behaviors. One resident asphyxiated on a rubber glove, while another ate a reported seven cigarettes and one feminine hygiene pad in the span of two days. Similarly, inappropriate feeding techniques and poor nutrition endangered residents' health.</p>\r\n<p>Virginia may have made an effort engage in productive negotiations, but the Department of Justice was not satisfied. On February 8, 1995, the Department of Justice notified the Governor of Virginia that, in addition to being unconstitutional, the conditions at NVTC violated the Americans With Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 12101 et seq., Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 794, the Social Security Act (\"Medicaid\"), 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1396 et seq., and Virginia law.</p>\r\n<p>On March 4, 1996, the Department of Justice filed a CRIPA lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, challenging conditions at NVTC. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to address (1) individualized programming, (2) undue physical restraint and isolation, (3) facility safety, (4) medical care, (5) physical and occupational therapy, (6) medication monitoring, especially for tardive dyskenesia, and (7) staff numbers and training.</p>\r\n<p>On May 21, 1996, the court (Judge Leonie M. Brinkema) refused to consolidate this lawsuit with United States v. Virginia, No. 96-284, <a href=\"../../../../case/427/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">U.S. v. Virginia</a>, an action challenging the constitutionality of conditions at a Virginia psychiatric hospital. On May 21, 1996, the court also granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, but stayed its ruling to allow for settlement. On July 18, 1996, the court approved a settlement agreement.</p>\r\n<p>The settlement agreement itself was mostly concerned with procedural elements, such as development of a plan for improvement, compliance deadlines, evaluation, and dismissal. The NVTC plan describes the required compliance. The plan emphasizes the importance of trained staff in the provision of developmental disability services. The plan stated detailed training requirements for direct care staff and incorporated training into almost every solution. For instance, the plan mandated the dismissal of employees who neglected or abused residents. Similarly, the plan sought to reduce the need for restraints by both improving staff development and requiring the interdisciplinary treatment teams' advance approval for the type of restraints to be used for each individual. Thus, both chemical restraints and draconian physical restraint techniques, such as papoose boards, were eliminated. Similar clauses addressed medical care, medication administration and tracking, physical and occupational therapy, abuse and injury reporting and investigations, recordkeeping, functional planning, community placement, and quality assurance.</p>\r\n<p>The parties modified the settlement on May 30, 1997. On August 29, 1997, the Department of Justice inspected NVTC and found it was in compliance with the plan. On June 3, 1998, the court dismissed the lawsuit.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

              "text": "<p>On May 4, 1990, the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division announced, in a letter to the Governor of Virginia, its intent to launch an investigation, pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1997 et seq., into conditions at the Northern Virginia Training Center (NVTC), an institution for individuals with developmental disabilities in Fairfax, Virginia. Five experts from the Department of Justice toured the facility, reviewed policies and procedures, interviewed NVTC staff, and audited reporting and investigation practices.</p>\r\n<p>On April 9, 1991, the Department of Justice announced its findings. The Department of Justice reported that the health and safety of people living at NVTC was at risk for a number of reasons. NVTC employed too few people and inadequately trained those it did employ, which placed residents in danger of unnecessary chexmical and physical restraint. Often mechanical restraints were accompanied by seclusion, which was a fire hazard. Individualized programming for residents was inadequate and recordkeeping deficiencies made it impossible to monitor an individual's progress. In addition, NVTC's medical care, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and medication and side effect monitoring we all inadequate. In addition, NVTC provided insufficient medical care, including medication monitoring and occupational therapy. Recordkeeping made it difficult to track the efficacy of individualized programming and medical care. In closing, the Department of Justice expressed the desire to negotiate a resolution.</p>\r\n<p>Negotiations did not make enough progress and, on May 31, 1994, the Department of Justice threatened to file a CRIPA lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of conditions at NVTC. In addition to its earlier concerns, the Department of Justice chronicled systematic abuse and neglect at NVTC. For instance, individualized training programs were so inadequate that individuals became seriously sick or died as the result of aggressive, pica, and other self-injurious behaviors. One resident asphyxiated on a rubber glove, while another ate a reported seven cigarettes and one feminine hygiene pad in the span of two days. Similarly, inappropriate feeding techniques and poor nutrition endangered residents' health.</p>\r\n<p>Virginia may have made an effort engage in productive negotiations, but the Department of Justice was not satisfied. On February 8, 1995, the Department of Justice notified the Governor of Virginia that, in addition to being unconstitutional, the conditions at NVTC violated the Americans With Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 12101 et seq., Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 794, the Social Security Act (\"Medicaid\"), 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1396 et seq., and Virginia law.</p>\r\n<p>On March 4, 1996, the Department of Justice filed a CRIPA lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, challenging conditions at NVTC. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to address (1) individualized programming, (2) undue physical restraint and isolation, (3) facility safety, (4) medical care, (5) physical and occupational therapy, (6) medication monitoring, especially for tardive dyskenesia, and (7) staff numbers and training.</p>\r\n<p>On May 21, 1996, the court (Judge Leonie M. Brinkema) refused to consolidate this lawsuit with United States v. Virginia, No. 96-284, <a href=\"../../../../case/427/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">U.S. v. Virginia</a>, an action challenging the constitutionality of conditions at a Virginia psychiatric hospital. On May 21, 1996, the court also granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, but stayed its ruling to allow for settlement. On July 18, 1996, the court approved a settlement agreement.</p>\r\n<p>The settlement agreement itself was mostly concerned with procedural elements, such as development of a plan for improvement, compliance deadlines, evaluation, and dismissal. The NVTC plan describes the required compliance. The plan emphasizes the importance of trained staff in the provision of developmental disability services. The plan stated detailed training requirements for direct care staff and incorporated training into almost every solution. For instance, the plan mandated the dismissal of employees who neglected or abused residents. Similarly, the plan sought to reduce the need for restraints by both improving staff development and requiring the interdisciplinary treatment teams' advance approval for the type of restraints to be used for each individual. Thus, both chemical restraints and draconian physical restraint techniques, such as papoose boards, were eliminated. Similar clauses addressed medical care, medication administration and tracking, physical and occupational therapy, abuse and injury reporting and investigations, recordkeeping, functional planning, community placement, and quality assurance.</p>\r\n<p>The parties modified the settlement on May 30, 1997. On August 29, 1997, the Department of Justice inspected NVTC and found it was in compliance with the plan. On June 3, 1998, the court dismissed the lawsuit.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

              "transformed_text": "Imagine a federal agency, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), like a national watchdog for fairness. In May 1990, they announced they would investigate a place called the Northern Virginia Training Center (NVTC) in Fairfax, Virginia. NVTC was a home for people with developmental disabilities, meaning they needed special support to live and learn. The DOJ started this investigation because of a federal law called the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act. Think of it as a law designed to protect people living in places like NVTC. Five experts from the DOJ visited NVTC. They looked at how things were run, talked to the staff, and checked how problems were reported and looked into.\n\nAbout a year later, in April 1991, the DOJ shared what they discovered. They found that the health and safety of the people living at NVTC were in danger for many reasons. There weren't enough staff members, and the ones who were there didn't have the right training. This led to residents being held back too often, sometimes with medicines or by tying them down, even when it wasn't needed. Sometimes, people were tied down and also kept alone in a room, which was dangerous and even created a fire risk. The special plans for each resident weren't good enough, and bad record-keeping made it hard to see if people were getting better. Also, the medical care, physical therapy (helping with movement), occupational therapy (helping with daily tasks), and how they watched over medications and their side effects were all not good enough. The DOJ finished their report by saying they hoped to find a solution together.\n\nTalks to fix things didn't go well enough. So, in May 1994, the DOJ warned NVTC that they would sue them, using that same Civil Rights Act. This lawsuit would ask if the way people were treated at NVTC was even legal under the U.S. Constitution. Besides the problems they already found, the DOJ also reported a lot of abuse and neglect happening at NVTC. For example, the special training programs were so bad that some residents got very sick or even died because of aggressive actions, eating things that weren't food (this is called pica), and other ways they hurt themselves. One person choked to death on a rubber glove, and another reportedly ate seven cigarettes and a feminine hygiene pad in just two days. It's truly shocking. Also, wrong ways of feeding people and poor food put residents' health in danger.\n\nEven though Virginia might have tried to work things out, the DOJ still wasn't happy with the progress. In February 1995, the DOJ told Virginia's Governor that the conditions at NVTC were not only against the Constitution but also broke several other federal laws. These laws included the Americans With Disabilities Act (which protects people with disabilities from discrimination), a part of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (another law protecting people with disabilities), the Social Security Act (which includes Medicaid, a health program), and even some of Virginia's own laws.\n\nSo, in March 1996, the DOJ officially filed their lawsuit against NVTC in a federal court in Eastern Virginia, using that Civil Rights Act again. The lawsuit's goal was to force changes at NVTC. They asked the court to order NVTC to fix problems with: (1) personalized plans for residents, (2) using too many physical restraints and keeping people alone, (3) making the place safe, (4) medical care, (5) physical and occupational therapy, (6) how medicines were watched (especially for side effects like uncontrolled movements, called tardive dyskinesia), and (7) having enough trained staff.\n\nIn May 1996, the judge in charge, Judge Leonie M. Brinkema, decided not to combine this case with another one, *United States v. Virginia*, which was about problems at a different mental health hospital in Virginia. On the same day, the court actually agreed with NVTC's request to throw out the whole case. But, the judge put that decision on hold, giving both sides a chance to work out an agreement instead of continuing the lawsuit. In July 1996, the court approved an agreement that the DOJ and NVTC had worked out.\n\nThis agreement mainly focused on how to make things better at NVTC. It laid out clear steps: create a plan for improvement, set deadlines for reaching goals, check how things were going, and eventually close the lawsuit. The NVTC plan detailed exactly what the center had to do to follow this agreement. The plan really emphasized that staff caring for people with developmental disabilities needed to be well-trained. It had specific rules for training the staff who directly cared for residents, and training was a key part of almost every solution. For example, the plan said that employees who neglected or abused residents had to be fired. It also aimed to use fewer restraints by making staff better at their jobs. It required a team of experts to approve any type of restraint *before* it could be used on a resident. This meant that certain drug-based restraints and harsh physical restraints, like \"papoose boards\" (a board used to hold children still), were completely banned. The agreement also had similar rules for medical care, handling and tracking medicines, physical and occupational therapy, reporting and investigating abuse and injuries, keeping good records, planning for residents' daily needs, helping residents live in the community, and making sure everything was high quality.\n\nBoth sides made small changes to the agreement in May 1997. In August 1997, the DOJ checked NVTC and confirmed that the center was following the plan. Finally, in June 1998, the court officially closed the lawsuit, meaning the case was over.",

              "transformed_text": "The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is like a government watchdog. In May 1990, they decided to look into a place called Northern Virginia Training Center (NVTC) in Virginia. NVTC was a home for people who needed special help to live and learn. The DOJ started this because of a special federal law. It was called the \"Rights of People in Special Homes Act.\" This law was made to protect people living in places like NVTC. Five experts from the DOJ visited NVTC. They checked how things worked. They talked to staff. They looked at how problems were handled.\n\nAbout a year later, in April 1991, the DOJ shared what they found. They found that people living at NVTC were not safe or healthy. This was for many reasons. There were not enough staff. The staff they had were not trained well. This meant residents were held back too much. Sometimes they used medicine. Sometimes they tied people down. This was not always needed. Sometimes, people were tied down and kept alone. This was dangerous. It could even cause a fire. Plans for each person were not good. Records were messy. It was hard to see if people were getting better. Also, medical care was not good. Help with movement (physical therapy) was not good. Help with daily tasks (occupational therapy) was not good. They did not watch medicines or their side effects well enough. The DOJ ended their report. They hoped to fix things together.\n\nTalking to fix things did not work well. So, in May 1994, the DOJ warned NVTC. They said they would sue them. They would use the \"Rights of People in Special Homes Act\" again. This lawsuit would ask if how people were treated was even allowed by the U.S. Constitution. The DOJ also found a lot of abuse and neglect at NVTC. This was on top of the other problems. For example, training programs were so bad. Some residents got very sick. Some even died. This was from hurting themselves. Or from eating things that were not food (called pica). One person choked on a rubber glove and died. Another person reportedly ate seven cigarettes and a feminine hygiene pad in two days. This was shocking. Also, wrong ways of feeding people and bad food made residents unhealthy.\n\nVirginia might have tried to fix things. But the DOJ was still not happy with how fast things were changing. In February 1995, the DOJ told Virginia's Governor. They said NVTC's conditions were against the Constitution. They also broke other federal laws. These laws included the Americans With Disabilities Act. This law protects people with disabilities. It also broke part of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This is another law for people with disabilities. It broke the Social Security Act, which includes Medicaid. Medicaid is a health program. It even broke some of Virginia's own laws.\n\nSo, in March 1996, the DOJ sued NVTC. They went to a federal court in Eastern Virginia. They used the \"Rights of People in Special Homes Act\" again. The lawsuit wanted to make NVTC change. They asked the court to make NVTC fix problems with: (1) personal plans for residents, (2) using too many physical restraints and keeping people alone, (3) making the place safe, (4) medical care, (5) physical and occupational therapy, (6) watching medicines, especially for bad side effects like uncontrolled movements (called tardive dyskinesia), and (7) having enough trained staff.\n\nIn May 1996, the judge, Leonie M. Brinkema, made a decision. She said this case would not be joined with another case. That other case was about a different hospital in Virginia. On the same day, the court agreed with NVTC. NVTC wanted the whole case thrown out. But the judge stopped that decision. She gave both sides a chance to agree. This was instead of continuing the lawsuit. In July 1996, the court approved an agreement. The DOJ and NVTC had worked it out.\n\nThis agreement was mostly about making things better at NVTC. It listed clear steps. They would make a plan to get better. They would set dates to meet goals. They would check how things were going. Then, they would close the lawsuit. The NVTC plan showed exactly what the center had to do to follow this agreement. The plan stressed that staff needed good training. This was for caring for people with developmental disabilities. It had clear rules for training staff who cared for residents. Training was a big part of almost every fix. For example, the plan said staff who hurt or ignored residents had to be fired. It also aimed to use fewer restraints. This was by making staff better at their jobs. A team of experts had to approve any restraint. This had to happen *before* it was used on a resident. This meant some drug restraints were banned. Harsh physical restraints were also banned. Things like \"papoose boards\" (a board to hold children still) were not allowed at all. The agreement had similar rules for other things. These included medical care, handling medicines, physical and occupational therapy. Also, reporting abuse and injuries, keeping good records, planning for residents' daily needs, helping residents live in the community, and making sure everything was good quality.\n\nBoth sides made small changes to the agreement in May 1997. In August 1997, the DOJ checked NVTC. They saw the center was following the plan. Finally, in June 1998, the court officially closed the lawsuit. This meant the case was over.",

              "text": "<p>On May 4, 1990, the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division announced, in a letter to the Governor of Virginia, its intent to launch an investigation, pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1997 et seq., into conditions at the Northern Virginia Training Center (NVTC), an institution for individuals with developmental disabilities in Fairfax, Virginia. Five experts from the Department of Justice toured the facility, reviewed policies and procedures, interviewed NVTC staff, and audited reporting and investigation practices.</p>\r\n<p>On April 9, 1991, the Department of Justice announced its findings. The Department of Justice reported that the health and safety of people living at NVTC was at risk for a number of reasons. NVTC employed too few people and inadequately trained those it did employ, which placed residents in danger of unnecessary chexmical and physical restraint. Often mechanical restraints were accompanied by seclusion, which was a fire hazard. Individualized programming for residents was inadequate and recordkeeping deficiencies made it impossible to monitor an individual's progress. In addition, NVTC's medical care, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and medication and side effect monitoring we all inadequate. In addition, NVTC provided insufficient medical care, including medication monitoring and occupational therapy. Recordkeeping made it difficult to track the efficacy of individualized programming and medical care. In closing, the Department of Justice expressed the desire to negotiate a resolution.</p>\r\n<p>Negotiations did not make enough progress and, on May 31, 1994, the Department of Justice threatened to file a CRIPA lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of conditions at NVTC. In addition to its earlier concerns, the Department of Justice chronicled systematic abuse and neglect at NVTC. For instance, individualized training programs were so inadequate that individuals became seriously sick or died as the result of aggressive, pica, and other self-injurious behaviors. One resident asphyxiated on a rubber glove, while another ate a reported seven cigarettes and one feminine hygiene pad in the span of two days. Similarly, inappropriate feeding techniques and poor nutrition endangered residents' health.</p>\r\n<p>Virginia may have made an effort engage in productive negotiations, but the Department of Justice was not satisfied. On February 8, 1995, the Department of Justice notified the Governor of Virginia that, in addition to being unconstitutional, the conditions at NVTC violated the Americans With Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 12101 et seq., Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 794, the Social Security Act (\"Medicaid\"), 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1396 et seq., and Virginia law.</p>\r\n<p>On March 4, 1996, the Department of Justice filed a CRIPA lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, challenging conditions at NVTC. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to address (1) individualized programming, (2) undue physical restraint and isolation, (3) facility safety, (4) medical care, (5) physical and occupational therapy, (6) medication monitoring, especially for tardive dyskenesia, and (7) staff numbers and training.</p>\r\n<p>On May 21, 1996, the court (Judge Leonie M. Brinkema) refused to consolidate this lawsuit with United States v. Virginia, No. 96-284, <a href=\"../../../../case/427/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">U.S. v. Virginia</a>, an action challenging the constitutionality of conditions at a Virginia psychiatric hospital. On May 21, 1996, the court also granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, but stayed its ruling to allow for settlement. On July 18, 1996, the court approved a settlement agreement.</p>\r\n<p>The settlement agreement itself was mostly concerned with procedural elements, such as development of a plan for improvement, compliance deadlines, evaluation, and dismissal. The NVTC plan describes the required compliance. The plan emphasizes the importance of trained staff in the provision of developmental disability services. The plan stated detailed training requirements for direct care staff and incorporated training into almost every solution. For instance, the plan mandated the dismissal of employees who neglected or abused residents. Similarly, the plan sought to reduce the need for restraints by both improving staff development and requiring the interdisciplinary treatment teams' advance approval for the type of restraints to be used for each individual. Thus, both chemical restraints and draconian physical restraint techniques, such as papoose boards, were eliminated. Similar clauses addressed medical care, medication administration and tracking, physical and occupational therapy, abuse and injury reporting and investigations, recordkeeping, functional planning, community placement, and quality assurance.</p>\r\n<p>The parties modified the settlement on May 30, 1997. On August 29, 1997, the Department of Justice inspected NVTC and found it was in compliance with the plan. On June 3, 1998, the court dismissed the lawsuit.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

              "transformed_text": "On May 4, 1990, the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division began an inquiry into the Northern Virginia Training Center (NVTC), an institution for individuals with developmental disabilities. This initiative, empowered by the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), sought to uncover and address potential systemic issues affecting residents' well-being.\n\nBy April 9, 1991, the Department revealed its findings, which exposed severe risks to the health and safety of NVTC residents. Deficiencies included understaffing, inadequate training, dangerous use of restraints, and insufficient individualized programming and medical care. Recognizing the gravity of the situation, the Department sought to resolve these issues through negotiation, hoping to secure voluntary improvements without further action.\n\nHowever, these discussions yielded insufficient progress. By May 31, 1994, the Department escalated its approach, signaling its intent to bring a CRIPA challenge. This move was prompted by persistent, systemic abuse and neglect, including tragic instances where residents suffered severe harm or even death due to self-injurious behaviors and poor nutrition. The Department aimed to compel Virginia to rectify these dire conditions through formal means.\n\nTo strengthen its position, on February 8, 1995, the Department informed the Governor of Virginia that NVTC's conditions not only violated constitutional rights but also contravened the Americans With Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and other state and federal mandates. This broadened legal basis underscored the comprehensive nature of the facility's failings.\n\nWith all attempts at pre-litigation resolution exhausted, on March 4, 1996, the Department formally initiated a federal proceeding. Its purpose was to secure judicial remedies that would compel NVTC to address fundamental deficiencies, including inadequate individualized programming, excessive physical restraint and isolation, safety concerns, and shortcomings in medical and therapeutic care, as well as staff numbers and training. This proceeding represented a direct appeal for intervention to protect vulnerable individuals.\n\nOn May 21, 1996, the presiding judge, Leonie M. Brinkema, opted against combining this matter with a separate concern regarding a psychiatric hospital, keeping the focus distinct on NVTC. On the same day, the facility's representatives sought to have the entire matter closed. While the judge initially acknowledged their arguments, she strategically deferred a final decision, creating an imperative for the parties to reach a resolution outside of a full trial. This judicial encouragement led to a comprehensive accord, which was formally approved on July 18, 1996.\n\nThe resulting accord served as a detailed blueprint for NVTC's transformation. It outlined specific requirements for improvement, including strict deadlines and methods for evaluation. The plan emphasized the critical role of well-trained staff in providing quality developmental disability services, mandating comprehensive training and even dismissal for neglectful employees. It also aimed to eliminate harsh physical and chemical restraints by improving staff development and requiring advance approval for any restraint use. Similar provisions addressed medical care, recordkeeping, and community placement, all designed to ensure lasting positive change and accountability.\n\nFollowing minor adjustments to the agreement on May 30, 1997, the Department confirmed NVTC's adherence to the reforms through an inspection on August 29, 1997. With the facility demonstrating compliance, the court concluded its oversight and closed the matter on June 3, 1998, signifying the successful implementation of the necessary changes and the resolution of the initial crisis.",

This positive transformation followed an extensive inquiry by the Department of Justice, which uncovered severe deficiencies, including systemic abuse and neglect. When initial negotiations to address these critical issues stalled, a comprehensive agreement was reached. This accord, formally approved on July 18, 1996, served as a detailed blueprint for NVTC's overhaul. It mandated crucial improvements such as comprehensive training for staff, with provisions for dismissing neglectful employees, and the elimination of harsh physical and chemical restraints. The agreement also outlined requirements for better medical care, accurate recordkeeping, and increased opportunities for community placement. These provisions were designed to ensure lasting positive change and accountability for the residents. After minor adjustments and a Department of Justice inspection confirmed NVTC's full adherence to these reforms, the matter was closed on June 3, 1998, signifying the successful realization of necessary changes and a significant victory for the rights of institutionalized individuals.",

Residents endured systemic neglect and even abuse, often subjected to harsh physical and chemical restraints. Their medical care was inadequate, and their records were poorly kept, leaving them vulnerable. Opportunities to live outside the institution, within the wider community, were scarce.\n\nConcerned by these grave conditions, the Department of Justice stepped in, launching a thorough investigation. They uncovered the severe deficiencies, but initial attempts to negotiate improvements stalled. Undeterred, the Department of Justice pressed on, eventually securing a comprehensive agreement.\n\nThis agreement became a blueprint for a complete overhaul, transforming life at NVTC. Staff received extensive training, and those who neglected residents were held accountable and dismissed. The use of cruel physical and chemical restraints was eliminated. Residents began to receive proper medical care, their records were accurately maintained, and, crucially, new pathways opened for them to live more independently in the community. After a final inspection confirmed these vital changes were fully in place, a new chapter began for the residents, one marked by dignity and improved care.",

They asserted violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Rehabilitation Act (RA), the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA), and California state law. Plaintiffs alleged authorities used excessive force, including pepper spray, physical force, prone restraint, isolation, and solitary confinement, disrupting access to educational services, including special education, and providing inadequate mental health, rehabilitative, and reentry supports.\n\nPlaintiffs filed a complaint on February 21, 2018, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, seeking class certification, declaratory and injunctive relief, a special master, and attorneys' fees. Proceedings were stayed for settlement negotiations. The case was reassigned to Magistrate Judge Jennifer L. Thurston in July 2019 by consent. Magistrate Judge Thurston lifted the stay a month later, following settlement. On August 30, 2019, the class was certified by consent, and guardians ad litem were appointed for named plaintiffs.\n\nThe settlement defined the class as: \"[A]ll youth with mental health, behavioral, learning, intellectual and/or developmental disabilities . . . who are currently detained, or who will be detained during the Monitoring Term (through August 31, 2022), at the Kern County Juvenile Facilities (Juvenile Hall, Crossroads, and Camp Erwin Owen).\"\n\nThe settlement mandated policy and practice changes at Kern County juvenile facilities via a Probation Action Plan and a Court Schools Implementation Plan.

The agreement also established monitoring through August 31, 2022.\n\nThe court granted preliminary approval of the class settlement on December 4, 2019, and final approval on June 5, 2020, awarding plaintiffs $1,758,743.43 in costs and fees.\n\nMonitoring was paused from May 6, 2020, through March 29, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

              "transformed_text": "This case involved claims of abuse and not providing proper education to young people with disabilities held in juvenile detention centers in Kern County, California. The plaintiffs, represented by groups like Disability Rights California and Disability Rights Advocates, sued Kern County, its Probation Department, the County Superintendent of Schools, and two specific officials. They claimed these parties violated federal laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act (RA), as well as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA), along with California state law. They said authorities used too much force and did not provide educational services to young people with disabilities in their care. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that using pepper spray, physical force, face-down restraints, and isolation or solitary confinement stopped these young people from getting educational services, including special education. They also claimed that mental health support, rehabilitation, and services to help them re-enter society were not good enough.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed their lawsuit on February 21, 2018, in a federal court in California, before Judge S. Sant Egata. They asked the court to certify the case as a class action, declare certain actions illegal, issue temporary and permanent orders to stop harmful practices, appoint a special monitor, and award them legal fees. The next month, on March 9, the court put the case on hold so the parties could try to reach a settlement. In July 2019, with both sides agreeing, the case was moved to Magistrate Judge Jennifer L. Thurston. Judge Thurston removed the hold a month later, on August 1, because the parties had reached an agreement. On August 30, 2019, all parties agreed to certify the case as a class action. A few months after that, on October 1, legal guardians were appointed for the specific plaintiffs named in the suit.\n\nThe settlement agreement defined the group of people covered by the lawsuit as:\n\n> All young people with mental health, behavioral, learning, intellectual, or developmental disabilities who are currently or will be held at Kern County's juvenile facilities (Juvenile Hall, Crossroads, and Camp Erwin Owen) during the monitoring period (through August 31, 2022).\n\nThe settlement agreement required changes to policies and practices at the Kern County juvenile detention centers, based on a Probation Action Plan and a Court Schools Implementation Plan. These changes included improvements to: 1) the facility's overall culture and environment, 2) how cases are managed, 3) available programs, 4) training and teamwork to create a safe crisis management system that focuses on calming situations down, and working with the Kern County superintendent to include ADA accommodations, Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), mental health services related to education, and other supports, 5) surveys for young people, their families, and staff to give feedback on programs and treatment, 6) ways to make complaints, 7) rules for using pepper spray and other force, 8) rules about isolation and solitary confinement, 9) having specialized staff, 10) individual safety and security plans, 11) suicide prevention, and 12) services to help young people return to the community. The agreement also included a plan to monitor these changes until August 31, 2022.\n\nThe court gave its initial approval of the class settlement on December 4, 2019. It then gave final approval on June 5, 2020, and ordered about $1.76 million to be paid to the plaintiffs for their legal costs and fees.\n\nThe monitoring period was paused from May 6, 2020, to March 29, 2021, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. On August 15, 2023, Magistrate Judge Christopher D. Baker approved a request, agreed upon by both sides, to extend the monitoring period further. This was to make up for delays in putting the settlement into practice due to COVID-19. As a result, the monitor's final report was due on May 20, 2024.\n\nAs of May 23, 2024, no new developments have occurred, and the case is considered closed.",

              "transformed_text": "This case involved claims of abuse and failing to properly educate young people with disabilities held in juvenile detention centers in Kern County, California. The plaintiffs, represented by groups like Disability Rights California and Disability Rights Advocates, sued Kern County, its Probation Department, the County Superintendent of Schools, and two officials. They claimed these parties broke federal laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which protects people with disabilities from discrimination, and the Rehabilitation Act (RA), which prevents discrimination by programs that receive federal money. They also cited the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which ensures disabled students get a free and appropriate public education, along with California state law. They said authorities used too much force and failed to provide educational services to young people with disabilities in their care. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that using pepper spray, physical force, face-down restraints (where someone is held on their stomach), and isolation or solitary confinement (being held alone in a room) prevented these young people from getting educational services, including special education. They also claimed that mental health support, rehabilitation (helping them recover), and services to help them re-enter society were not good enough.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed their lawsuit on February 21, 2018, in a federal court in California, before Judge S. Sant Egata. They asked the court to approve the case as a \"class action\" (a lawsuit brought by one or more people on behalf of a larger group), to officially declare certain actions illegal, to issue temporary and permanent orders (court commands) to stop harmful practices, to appoint a special monitor (someone to oversee the changes), and to award them legal fees. The next month, on March 9, the court paused the case so both sides could try to reach a settlement (an agreement to resolve the dispute). In July 2019, with both sides agreeing, the case was moved to Magistrate Judge Jennifer L. Thurston. Judge Thurston lifted the pause a month later, on August 1, because the parties had reached an agreement. On August 30, 2019, all parties agreed to officially approve the case as a class action. A few months after that, on October 1, legal guardians (people legally responsible for the named plaintiffs) were appointed for the specific plaintiffs named in the suit.\n\nThe settlement agreement defined the group of people covered by the lawsuit as:\n\n> All young people with mental health, behavioral, learning, intellectual, or developmental disabilities who are currently or will be held at Kern County's juvenile facilities (Juvenile Hall, Crossroads, and Camp Erwin Owen) during the monitoring period (through August 31, 2022).\n\nThe settlement agreement required changes to policies and practices at the Kern County juvenile detention centers, based on a plan from the Probation Department and a plan for the Court Schools. These changes included improvements to: 1) the facility's overall culture and environment, 2) how cases are managed, 3) available programs, 4) training and teamwork to create a safe way to handle crises that focuses on calming situations down, and working with the Kern County superintendent to include accommodations required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) (special plans for students with disabilities), mental health services related to education, and other supports, 5) surveys for young people, their families, and staff to give feedback on programs and treatment, 6) ways to make complaints, 7) rules for using pepper spray and other force, 8) rules about isolation and solitary confinement, 9) having specialized staff, 10) individual safety and security plans, 11) suicide prevention, and 12) services to help young people return to the community.

It was about claims that young people with disabilities were mistreated and not given proper education while staying in juvenile detention centers in Kern County, California.\n\nGroups like Disability Rights California and Disability Rights Advocates, acting on behalf of these young people, sued Kern County, its Probation Department, the County Superintendent of Schools, and two officials. They claimed these groups broke federal laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which makes sure people with disabilities are treated fairly, and the Rehabilitation Act, which says programs getting federal money can't discriminate. They also said these places broke the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which guarantees students with disabilities get the education they need for free, along with California state law. The lawsuit claimed that authorities used too much force and didn't provide enough educational services to these young people.

They also said the support for mental health, helping them get back on track, and preparing them to return to their communities wasn't good enough.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed their lawsuit on February 21, 2018, in a federal court in California. They asked the court to approve the case as a \"class action\" – that's like when one or a few people sue on behalf of a much larger group who have the same problem. They also asked the court to say officially that what was happening was against the law, to order the county to stop these harmful things, both for a little while and forever, to have a special person watch over things to make sure the changes actually happened, and to make the county pay for their lawyers.\n\nThe next month, on March 9, the court paused the case so both sides could try to reach a settlement – that's like an agreement to solve the problem without going to a full trial. In July 2019, with both sides agreeing, the case was moved to Magistrate Judge Jennifer L. Thurston. Judge Thurston lifted the pause a month later, on August 1, because they had reached an agreement. On August 30, 2019, all parties agreed to officially approve the case as a class action.

These changes were based on plans from the Probation Department and the Court Schools. These improvements covered things like: 1) making the overall atmosphere and environment of the centers better, 2) improving how they handled each young person's case, 3) offering more and better programs, 4) providing training and working together to handle tough situations safely, focusing on calming things down. This also meant working with the Kern County superintendent to make sure they followed the ADA rules, provided IEPs (which are special learning plans for students with disabilities), offered mental health support for education, and other help. The agreement also covered: 5) creating surveys for young people, their families, and staff to share what they thought about the programs and how they were treated, 6) setting up clear ways for people to make complaints, 7) changing the rules about using pepper spray and other force, 8) changing the rules about putting young people in isolation or solitary confinement, 9) making sure there were enough staff with special training, 10) creating individual safety plans for each young person, 11) improving efforts to prevent suicide, and 12) providing services to help young people get back into their communities. The agreement also said someone would watch over these changes until August 31, 2022, to make sure they were actually happening.\n\nThe court first approved this class action agreement on December 4, 2019. Then, on June 5, 2020, it gave its final approval and ordered about $1.76 million to be paid to the young people's lawyers to cover their costs.\n\nThe time period for watching over the changes was paused from May 6, 2020, to March 29, 2021, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. On August 15, 2023, Judge Christopher D. Baker approved a request from both sides to extend the monitoring period even longer. This was because the COVID-19 pandemic had caused delays in actually making the changes happen.

              "transformed_text": "Imagine you're in a civics class, and we're talking about how our legal system works to protect people. This case is a good example. This story is about young people. They have disabilities. They were in jails for kids in Kern County, California. People said they were treated badly. And they didn't get the right education.\n\nTwo groups, Disability Rights California and Disability Rights Advocates, helped these young people. They sued Kern County. They also sued the county's jail department, the school boss for the county, and two other people. The groups said these places broke federal laws. One law is the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA. It makes sure people with disabilities are treated fairly. Another law is the Rehabilitation Act. It says places that get money from the government can't treat people differently because of a disability. They also said the places broke the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA. This law makes sure students with disabilities get the education they need for free. They also broke California state laws. The lawsuit said that people in charge used too much force. And they didn't give these young people enough schooling. For example, they said pepper spray was used. They said kids were held down. And some kids were put alone in rooms. This stopped them from learning. Especially kids who needed special education. They also said the help for mental health wasn't good enough. And the help to get them ready to go back home wasn't good enough either.\n\nThe groups filed the lawsuit on February 21, 2018. It was in a special federal court in California. They asked the court to make it a \"class action.\" This means one lawsuit can help many people with the same problem. They also asked the court to say the actions were wrong. They wanted the court to make the county stop the bad things. They wanted someone to watch over the changes. And they wanted the county to pay for their lawyers.\n\nThe next month, on March 9, the court stopped the case for a bit. This was so both sides could try to agree on a solution. This is called a settlement. In July 2019, both sides agreed to move the case to a different judge, Judge Jennifer L. Thurston. Judge Thurston restarted the case a month later, on August 1. This was because they had reached an agreement. On August 30, 2019, everyone agreed to make it an official class action. A few months later, on October 1, special adults were chosen. They would legally speak for the young people in the lawsuit.\n\nThe agreement described the young people the lawsuit was for:\n\n> It included all young people with mental health, behavior, learning, or growth problems. These kids were living at Kern County's juvenile centers. This included places like Juvenile Hall, Crossroads, and Camp Erwin Owen. This covered kids there until August 31, 2022.\n\nThe agreement said the kids' jails in Kern County had to change their rules. They had to change how they did things. These changes came from plans made by the jail department and the court schools. The changes included: 1) making the places feel better and safer, 2) handling each young person's situation better, 3) offering more and better activities, 4) training staff to handle problems safely. This meant calming situations down. They also had to work with the county's school boss. This was to make sure they followed ADA rules. They had to give special learning plans called IEPs. They also had to offer mental health help for school. And other kinds of help. The agreement also covered: 5) making surveys for kids, families, and staff to share their ideas, 6) making clear ways for people to complain, 7) changing rules about pepper spray and force, 8) changing rules about putting kids alone in rooms, 9) making sure there were enough trained staff, 10) making safety plans for each kid, 11) working harder to stop suicide, and 12) helping kids get ready to go back home. Someone would watch these changes. They would make sure they happened. This would last until August 31, 2022.\n\nThe court first said yes to this agreement on December 4, 2019. Then, on June 5, 2020, the court gave its final okay. It ordered about $1.76 million to be paid to the young people's lawyers. This was to cover their costs.\n\nThe time for watching the changes was stopped. This was from May 6, 2020, to March 29, 2021. It was because of the COVID-19 pandemic. On August 15, 2023, Judge Christopher D. Baker said yes to a new request. Both sides wanted to watch the changes for even longer. This was because COVID-19 had made things slow down. The changes took longer to happen. So, the person watching now had until May 20, 2024, to give their final report.\n\nAs of May 23, 2024, nothing else has happened. The case is now finished.",

Plaintiffs, represented by Disability Rights California and Disability Rights Advocates, sued Kern County, the Kern County Probation Department, the Kern County Superintendent of Schools, and two individual officials. They alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act (RA), the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA), and California state law when authorities used excessive force and failed to provide educational services to youth with disabilities in their care. Specifically, plaintiffs alleged use of pepper spray, physical force, prone restraint, and isolation and solitary confinement that disrupted access to educational services, including special education. Furthermore, plaintiffs alleged inadequate mental health, rehabilitative, and reentry supports and services.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs filed a complaint on February 21, 2018 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California before Judge S. Sant Egata. They sought class certification, a declaratory judgment, preliminary and permanent injunctions, a special master, and attorneys' fees.&nbsp;The following month, on March 9, the court stayed the proceedings in order for the parties to enter settlement negotiations. In July 2019 the case was reassigned to Magistrate Judge Jennifer L. Thurston based on the parties' consent. Magistrate Judge Thurston lifted the stay a month later, on August 1, because the parties had settled. On August 30, 2019, the class was certified by consent of all parties. A few months later, on October 1, guardians ad litem were appointed for named plaintiffs.</p>\r\n<p>The settlement defined the class as:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>[A]ll youth with mental health, behavioral, learning, intellectual and/or developmental disabilities . . . who are currently detained, or who will be detained during the Monitoring Term (through August 31, 2022), at the Kern County Juvenile Facilities (Juvenile Hall, Crossroads, and Camp Erwin Owen).</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The settlement enforced changes in policy and practice at the Kern County juvenile detention facilities pursuant to a Probation Action Plan and a Court Schools Implementation Plan, which included reforms to 1) facility culture and environment, 2) the case management system, 3) programming, 4) training and coordination to develop a safe crisis management system focused on de-escalation, and to work with the Kern County superintendent to integrate ADA accommodations, Individualized Education Programs, Educationally Related Mental Health Services, and other services, 5) surveys for detained youth, families and staff to provide feedback on facility programs and treatment, 6) complaints and grievance procedures, 7) pepper spray and use of force, 8) isolation, seclusion and confinement, 9) specialized staffing, 10) the individualized safety and security program, 11) suicide prevention, and 12) re-entry. The agreement also included monitoring through August 31, 2022.</p>\r\n<p>The court granted preliminary approval of the class settlement on December 4, 2019. 2019 WL 6529083. It granted final approval on June 5, 2020, and awarded $1,758,743.43 in costs and fees to the plaintiffs. 2020 WL 3035199.</p>\r\n<p>Monitoring was paused from May 6, 2020 through March 29, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On August 15, 2023, Magistrate Judge Christopher D Baker granted a stipulated request to further extend the term of monitoring to account for delays in implementation due to COVID-19. 2023 WL 5242359. Therefore, the monitor's final report was due May 20, 2024.</p>\r\n<p>As of May 23, 2024, there have been no further developments and the case is presumed closed.</p>",

              "transformed_text": "In a significant legal chapter concerning the rights of vulnerable youth, a lawsuit emerged from allegations of abuse and educational neglect within Kern County's juvenile detention facilities. Advocacy groups, Disability Rights California and Disability Rights Advocates, stepped forward to represent youth with disabilities, accusing Kern County authorities of violating federal and state laws. Their grievances detailed systemic issues, including the use of excessive force—like pepper spray and solitary confinement—and a profound failure to provide essential educational and mental health services, disrupting the lives of these detained children.\n\nTo compel change and secure justice for these youth, the plaintiffs formally initiated legal action by filing a complaint in February 2018. Their suit aimed to represent all affected youth (seeking class certification), obtain a legal declaration that the county's practices were unlawful (a declaratory judgment), and secure court orders (preliminary and permanent injunctions) to immediately halt harmful actions and mandate lasting reforms, with oversight from a special master. Recognizing the potential for a comprehensive resolution outside of protracted litigation, the court swiftly paused the case the following month, encouraging the parties to engage in direct settlement negotiations. This strategic pause proved fruitful, as the parties reached an agreement, leading the court to lift the stay. To formalize the reach of this agreement, the class of affected youth was certified by consent, encompassing all youth with mental health, behavioral, learning, intellectual, and/or developmental disabilities detained in Kern County's juvenile facilities. To ensure the minors' best interests were legally represented throughout the settlement process, guardians ad litem were also appointed.\n\nThe resulting settlement was a landmark commitment to systemic reform. It outlined extensive changes to policy and practice across the facilities, detailed in a Probation Action Plan and a Court Schools Implementation Plan. These plans addressed crucial areas such as facility culture, case management, programming, de-escalation training, integration of special education services, and improved complaint procedures, among others. A key component was the provision for ongoing monitoring, a vital mechanism to ensure the county's adherence to the agreed-upon changes and to sustain the reforms over time.\n\nThe court, after careful review, granted preliminary and then final approval to this class settlement, affirming its fairness and adequacy for the vulnerable population it aimed to protect. This final approval also included an award for the plaintiffs' legal costs. The commitment to reform faced an unexpected challenge with the COVID-19 pandemic, which necessitated a temporary pause in monitoring efforts. However, demonstrating a continued dedication to the settlement's goals, the monitoring period was later extended to account for these delays, ensuring the full implementation of the agreed-upon changes. As of May 2024, with the final monitoring report due, this significant case is presumed to have concluded, leaving behind a legacy of mandated improvements for youth with disabilities in Kern County's care.",

The plaintiffs filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina against the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The case was assigned to Judge William L. Osteen, Jr. and Magistrate Judge L. Patrick Auld.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs asserted that the defendants&rsquo; actions violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. In particular, the plaintiffs alleged that DHHS was discriminating against children with disabilities in child welfare custody by unnecessarily segregating them from their home communities and placing them in heavily restrictive, and often clinically inappropriate, psychiatric residential treatment facilities (PRTFs). The plaintiffs requested class-wide relief and asked the Court to certify the putative class and award permanent injunctive relief. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought class certification for those meeting the following criteria: (a) children who are or will be in North Carolina foster care, who are or will be in the custody of a North Carolina county department of social services; (b) with a mental impairment that substantially limits at least one major life activity, or a record of such an impairment; (c) who are unnecessarily institutionalized in a PRTF or who are at serious risk of such institutionalization.</p>\r\n<p>On March 6, 2023, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, removing one of the named plaintiffs. Later that month, on March 20, the defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim and lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\r\n<p>The United States filed a statement of interest in support of the plaintiffs' claims on April 21, 2023. The US argued that 1) the plaintiffs did not need opinions from state treatment professionals in order to establish that integrated settings were appropriate; 2) the children in state custody did not need to allege that their custodians chose community-based care; 3) pending state court proceedings about whether children should be placed in PRTFs did not prevent the plaintiffs from bringing these claims of unnecessary segregation; and 4) the plaintiffs had standing to bring claims against DHHS.</p>\r\n<p>Almost a year later, on March 29, 2024, Judge Osteen denied the defendants' motion to dismiss. 2024 WL 1350071. The Court held that the Plaintiffs had established standing and that their allegations met the requirements of <em><a href=\"../../../../case/11643/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">L.C. v. Olmstead</a></em>. Under <em>Olmstead</em>, community placement is required when: (1) community placement is appropriate; (2) &ldquo;the transfer from institutional care to a less restrictive setting is not opposed by the affected individual;&rdquo; and (3) &ldquo;the placement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs of others with mental disabilities.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The Court found that on the facts alleged, though some of the plaintiffs were frequently institutionalized, it was because of a lack of community-based alternatives, not because they required institutionalization, so the plaintiffs had still sufficiently alleged community placement was appropriate. Some plaintiffs were not in institutions but were allegedly at serious risk of being institutionalized, which is also covered by <em>Olmstead.</em> Second, the Court held that <em>Olmstead </em>did not require a minor to allege that their custodian requested community placement: the plaintiffs alleged that they desired community-based services, meeting the second <em>Olmstead </em>prong. Third, the Court held that plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that their placement in the community could be reasonably accommodated, stating that any inquiry into the effectiveness of the state&rsquo;s plan for community-based services was not necessary at the motion to dismiss stage. Finally, the court held that the Plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were not barred by issue preclusion based on state court hearings because the state court hearings were based on individual placements and not the systemic failures alleged here.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing as of April 26, 2024.&nbsp;</p>",

The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina denied the motion. The Court held plaintiffs established standing and their allegations satisfied *L.C. v.

It further held a minor's alleged desire for community-based services sufficed for the \"not opposed\" prong, and plaintiffs adequately alleged reasonable accommodation.

The plaintiffs filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina against the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The case was assigned to Judge William L. Osteen, Jr. and Magistrate Judge L. Patrick Auld.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs asserted that the defendants&rsquo; actions violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. In particular, the plaintiffs alleged that DHHS was discriminating against children with disabilities in child welfare custody by unnecessarily segregating them from their home communities and placing them in heavily restrictive, and often clinically inappropriate, psychiatric residential treatment facilities (PRTFs). The plaintiffs requested class-wide relief and asked the Court to certify the putative class and award permanent injunctive relief. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought class certification for those meeting the following criteria: (a) children who are or will be in North Carolina foster care, who are or will be in the custody of a North Carolina county department of social services; (b) with a mental impairment that substantially limits at least one major life activity, or a record of such an impairment; (c) who are unnecessarily institutionalized in a PRTF or who are at serious risk of such institutionalization.</p>\r\n<p>On March 6, 2023, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, removing one of the named plaintiffs. Later that month, on March 20, the defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim and lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\r\n<p>The United States filed a statement of interest in support of the plaintiffs' claims on April 21, 2023. The US argued that 1) the plaintiffs did not need opinions from state treatment professionals in order to establish that integrated settings were appropriate; 2) the children in state custody did not need to allege that their custodians chose community-based care; 3) pending state court proceedings about whether children should be placed in PRTFs did not prevent the plaintiffs from bringing these claims of unnecessary segregation; and 4) the plaintiffs had standing to bring claims against DHHS.</p>\r\n<p>Almost a year later, on March 29, 2024, Judge Osteen denied the defendants' motion to dismiss. 2024 WL 1350071. The Court held that the Plaintiffs had established standing and that their allegations met the requirements of <em><a href=\"../../../../case/11643/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">L.C. v. Olmstead</a></em>. Under <em>Olmstead</em>, community placement is required when: (1) community placement is appropriate; (2) &ldquo;the transfer from institutional care to a less restrictive setting is not opposed by the affected individual;&rdquo; and (3) &ldquo;the placement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs of others with mental disabilities.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The Court found that on the facts alleged, though some of the plaintiffs were frequently institutionalized, it was because of a lack of community-based alternatives, not because they required institutionalization, so the plaintiffs had still sufficiently alleged community placement was appropriate. Some plaintiffs were not in institutions but were allegedly at serious risk of being institutionalized, which is also covered by <em>Olmstead.</em> Second, the Court held that <em>Olmstead </em>did not require a minor to allege that their custodian requested community placement: the plaintiffs alleged that they desired community-based services, meeting the second <em>Olmstead </em>prong. Third, the Court held that plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that their placement in the community could be reasonably accommodated, stating that any inquiry into the effectiveness of the state&rsquo;s plan for community-based services was not necessary at the motion to dismiss stage. Finally, the court held that the Plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were not barred by issue preclusion based on state court hearings because the state court hearings were based on individual placements and not the systemic failures alleged here.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing as of April 26, 2024.&nbsp;</p>",

They sued on behalf of a group of North Carolina young people in foster care who have mental and behavioral health needs. The lawsuit was filed in a federal court, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, against the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Judge William L. Osteen, Jr. and Magistrate Judge L. Patrick Auld were assigned to the case.\n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that DHHS's actions broke the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Specifically, they alleged that DHHS was unfairly treating children with disabilities in foster care. They said DHHS was unnecessarily separating these children from their home communities. Instead, DHHS was placing them in very restrictive and often unsuitable mental health treatment centers (called PRTFs). The plaintiffs asked the Court to approve their lawsuit as a 'class action' for the entire group and to issue a permanent order to fix the issues.\n\nThe plaintiffs wanted the court to officially approve the group for the class action. This group would include: (a) children who are currently or will be in North Carolina foster care, under the care of a North Carolina county social services department; (b) who have a mental condition that significantly affects at least one major life activity, or a history of such a condition; and (c) who are placed in a PRTF without need, or are at serious risk of being placed in one.\n\nOn March 6, 2023, the plaintiffs updated their lawsuit filing, removing one of the people originally named. Later that month, on March 20, the defendants asked the court to dismiss the case. They argued that the plaintiffs' claims were not legally sound and that the court did not have the authority to hear the case.\n\nThe United States government filed an official document on April 21, 2023, supporting the plaintiffs' claims. The U.S. argued several points: 1) the plaintiffs did not need opinions from state medical experts to show that community settings were suitable; 2) the children in state care did not need to claim that their guardians chose community-based care; 3) ongoing state court cases about placing children in PRTFs did not stop the plaintiffs from suing over unnecessary separation; and 4) the plaintiffs had the legal right to sue DHHS.\n\nAlmost a year later, on March 29, 2024, Judge Osteen rejected the defendants' request to dismiss the case. The Court decided that the plaintiffs had shown they had the legal right to sue. It also found that their claims met the standards set by the Supreme Court case *L.C. v. Olmstead*. According to *Olmstead*, placing someone in a community setting is required if: (1) a community setting is suitable for them; (2) the person needing care does not object to moving from a facility to a less restrictive setting; and (3) the community placement can be managed without too much difficulty, considering the state's available resources and the needs of other people with mental disabilities.\n\nThe Court found that, based on the claims, some plaintiffs were often placed in facilities. However, this was due to a lack of community options, not because they truly needed to be in a facility. So, the plaintiffs had still sufficiently claimed that community placement was suitable. Some plaintiffs were not in facilities but were at high risk of being placed in one, which *Olmstead* also covers. Second, the Court ruled that *Olmstead* did not require a minor to claim that their guardian asked for community placement; the plaintiffs stated they wanted community-based services, which met the second part of the *Olmstead* test. Third, the Court found that plaintiffs had sufficiently claimed that their community placement could be managed without too much difficulty. It added that looking into how well the state's plan for community services worked was not necessary at this early stage of the lawsuit. Finally, the court decided that the plaintiffs' claims were not prevented by earlier state court rulings. This was because those state court hearings focused on individual placements, not the larger, system-wide problems alleged in this case.\n\nThis case is still ongoing as of April 26, 2024.",

The lawsuit was filed in federal court against the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Judges William L. Osteen, Jr. and L.

These laws protect people with disabilities from discrimination and ensure equal access. Specifically, they alleged DHHS was unfairly treating children with disabilities in foster care. They claimed the state was unnecessarily separating these children from their home communities. Instead, DHHS was placing them in highly restrictive mental health facilities, known as PRTFs, which were often not suitable.

              "transformed_text": "Imagine a few student groups, like your school's debate club or a community service organization, deciding to speak up for others. That's what three groups – Disability Rights North Carolina (DRNC), the NAACP, and Children's Rights – did when they filed a lawsuit on December 6, 2022. They were suing to help young people in North Carolina's foster care system who have mental health challenges or behavioral needs. They took the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to federal court. Two judges, William L. Osteen, Jr. and L. Patrick Auld, were put in charge of the case.\n\nThe groups argued that DHHS was breaking two important federal laws: the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Think of these laws like rules that make sure everyone, including people with disabilities, is treated fairly and has the same opportunities. Specifically, they said DHHS was treating children with disabilities in foster care unfairly. They claimed the state was unnecessarily taking these children away from their homes and communities. Instead, DHHS was putting them in special mental health facilities called PRTFs. These places were very strict and often not the best fit for the kids. The groups asked the court to make this a \"class action\" lawsuit. This means one lawsuit would represent a whole group of young people facing similar problems, not just a few individuals. They also wanted the court to issue a lasting order to fix these issues.\n\nThe groups wanted the court to officially say \"yes\" to this class action, including young people who fit certain descriptions. This group would include: (a) Kids who are currently in foster care in North Carolina, or will be soon, and are looked after by a county social services department; (b) Who have a mental health condition that makes everyday life much harder, or have had one in the past; and (c) And who are being put in those strict PRTF facilities without a real need, or are very likely to be put in one.\n\nOn March 6, 2023, the groups updated their lawsuit, taking out one of the individual young people they had originally named. Later that month, on March 20, DHHS (the defendants) asked the court to throw out the case entirely. They argued that the groups' claims weren't strong enough legally and that the court didn't even have the power to hear the case.\n\nThe U.S. government, like a helpful ally, filed an official document on April 21, 2023, supporting the groups' claims. The U.S. government made several key points: 1) The groups didn't need doctors from the state to say that living in a community setting was okay for these kids; 2) The kids in foster care didn't have to prove their guardians specifically asked for community care; 3) Even if there were other state court cases about placing kids in PRTFs, those shouldn't stop this lawsuit about unnecessarily separating children; and 4) The groups had the legal right to sue DHHS.\n\nAlmost a year later, on March 29, 2024, Judge Osteen said \"no\" to DHHS's request to throw out the case. The court decided that the groups did have the legal right to sue. The judge also found that their claims fit the rules set by a very important Supreme Court case called *Olmstead v. L.C.* Think of *Olmstead* like a three-part test. It says that states must place people with disabilities in community settings (like group homes or their own homes with support) instead of institutions if: (1) The community setting is right for them; (2) The person agrees to move from a strict facility to a less strict setting; and (3) The community placement can be handled well, considering what the state has available and what other people with mental disabilities need.\n\nThe court looked at the claims and saw that some of the young people were often put into those facilities. But this happened because there weren't enough community options, not because they absolutely had to be in a facility. So, the groups had still made a good enough argument that community placement was suitable. Some young people weren't in facilities yet, but they were at high risk of being put in one, and the *Olmstead* rule covers that too. Second, the court said *Olmstead* didn't require a young person to prove their guardian asked for community placement. The groups simply stated that the young people wanted community-based services, which met the second part of the *Olmstead* test. Third, the court found that the groups had made a good enough claim that community placement could be managed well. It also said that at this early stage of the lawsuit, they didn't need to dig into how well the state's plan for community services was actually working. Finally, the court decided that earlier decisions in state courts didn't stop the groups' claims. This is because those state court hearings were about individual placements, not the bigger, system-wide problems the groups were complaining about in this case.\n\nThe case is still ongoing as of April 26, 2024.",

The plaintiffs filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina against the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The case was assigned to Judge William L. Osteen, Jr. and Magistrate Judge L. Patrick Auld.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs asserted that the defendants&rsquo; actions violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. In particular, the plaintiffs alleged that DHHS was discriminating against children with disabilities in child welfare custody by unnecessarily segregating them from their home communities and placing them in heavily restrictive, and often clinically inappropriate, psychiatric residential treatment facilities (PRTFs). The plaintiffs requested class-wide relief and asked the Court to certify the putative class and award permanent injunctive relief. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought class certification for those meeting the following criteria: (a) children who are or will be in North Carolina foster care, who are or will be in the custody of a North Carolina county department of social services; (b) with a mental impairment that substantially limits at least one major life activity, or a record of such an impairment; (c) who are unnecessarily institutionalized in a PRTF or who are at serious risk of such institutionalization.</p>\r\n<p>On March 6, 2023, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, removing one of the named plaintiffs. Later that month, on March 20, the defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim and lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\r\n<p>The United States filed a statement of interest in support of the plaintiffs' claims on April 21, 2023. The US argued that 1) the plaintiffs did not need opinions from state treatment professionals in order to establish that integrated settings were appropriate; 2) the children in state custody did not need to allege that their custodians chose community-based care; 3) pending state court proceedings about whether children should be placed in PRTFs did not prevent the plaintiffs from bringing these claims of unnecessary segregation; and 4) the plaintiffs had standing to bring claims against DHHS.</p>\r\n<p>Almost a year later, on March 29, 2024, Judge Osteen denied the defendants' motion to dismiss. 2024 WL 1350071. The Court held that the Plaintiffs had established standing and that their allegations met the requirements of <em><a href=\"../../../../case/11643/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">L.C. v. Olmstead</a></em>. Under <em>Olmstead</em>, community placement is required when: (1) community placement is appropriate; (2) &ldquo;the transfer from institutional care to a less restrictive setting is not opposed by the affected individual;&rdquo; and (3) &ldquo;the placement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs of others with mental disabilities.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The Court found that on the facts alleged, though some of the plaintiffs were frequently institutionalized, it was because of a lack of community-based alternatives, not because they required institutionalization, so the plaintiffs had still sufficiently alleged community placement was appropriate. Some plaintiffs were not in institutions but were allegedly at serious risk of being institutionalized, which is also covered by <em>Olmstead.</em> Second, the Court held that <em>Olmstead </em>did not require a minor to allege that their custodian requested community placement: the plaintiffs alleged that they desired community-based services, meeting the second <em>Olmstead </em>prong. Third, the Court held that plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that their placement in the community could be reasonably accommodated, stating that any inquiry into the effectiveness of the state&rsquo;s plan for community-based services was not necessary at the motion to dismiss stage. Finally, the court held that the Plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were not barred by issue preclusion based on state court hearings because the state court hearings were based on individual placements and not the systemic failures alleged here.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing as of April 26, 2024.&nbsp;</p>",

              "transformed_text": "A pivotal legal challenge began on December 6, 2022, when Disability Rights North Carolina (DRNC), the NAACP, and Children's Rights initiated a lawsuit. Their purpose was to address what they perceived as a systemic failure within North Carolina's foster care system: the unnecessary segregation of youth with mental and behavioral health disabilities. They brought their claims against the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), arguing that the state was violating federal disability laws&mdash;the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act&mdash;by placing these vulnerable children in highly restrictive, often inappropriate, psychiatric residential treatment facilities (PRTFs) instead of providing care within their home communities. The plaintiffs sought to represent a broad class of foster children who were either unnecessarily institutionalized or at serious risk of such confinement, aiming for a court order that would compel the state to shift towards more integrated, community-based services.\n\nAfter a minor adjustment to their initial filing, the state, through DHHS, responded on March 20, 2023, with a strategic move: a motion to dismiss the entire case. This action was an attempt to end the lawsuit prematurely, asserting that the plaintiffs had failed to present a legally viable claim or that the court lacked the authority to hear the matter. Essentially, the state sought to avoid a full examination of its practices and the potential for a broad injunction.\n\nHowever, the plaintiffs found a powerful ally in the United States government, which filed a statement of interest on April 21, 2023, supporting their claims. This intervention underscored the federal government's view that the plaintiffs' legal arguments were sound, particularly regarding the interpretation of federal disability law and the right of these children to pursue their claims despite the state's procedural objections.\n\nNearly a year later, on March 29, 2024, the court delivered a significant ruling, denying the state's motion to dismiss. This decision was a crucial victory for the plaintiffs, ensuring the case would proceed. The judge concluded that the plaintiffs had a legitimate right to bring their claims and, critically, that their allegations aligned with the principles established in the landmark *Olmstead* Supreme Court decision. This precedent mandates community placement for individuals with disabilities when three conditions are met: (1) community placement is appropriate; (2) the individual does not oppose the transfer to a less restrictive setting; and (3) the placement can be reasonably accommodated by the state.\n\nThe court systematically addressed each *Olmstead* requirement based on the plaintiffs' allegations. First, it found that the plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged that community placement *was* appropriate, noting that even those frequently institutionalized were there due to a lack of community-based alternatives, not because their conditions inherently demanded institutionalization. The court also recognized that *Olmstead* covered those at serious risk of institutionalization. Second, the court clarified that *Olmstead* did not require a minor's custodian to request community placement; rather, the plaintiffs' own alleged desire for community-based services met this prong. Third, the court determined that the plaintiffs had adequately alleged that their placement in the community could be reasonably accommodated, deeming inquiries into the state's existing plans unnecessary at this early stage. Finally, the court rejected the state's argument that prior individual state court hearings barred this federal lawsuit, emphasizing that those hearings focused on individual placements, whereas this case addressed systemic failures in the state's provision of care.\n\nThe legal battle continues, with the core issues of systemic segregation now set to be fully litigated.",

              "transformed_text": "The central legal conflict in this case asks whether North Carolina's foster care system, by placing youth with mental and behavioral health disabilities in restrictive psychiatric facilities, violates federal disability laws requiring care in less restrictive, community-based settings. After Disability Rights North Carolina, the NAACP, and Children's Rights initiated a lawsuit alleging systemic segregation, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services moved to dismiss the case, attempting to end the litigation prematurely.\n\nThe court, supported by a statement of interest from the United States government, denied the state's motion to dismiss, allowing the lawsuit to proceed. The judge concluded that the plaintiffs had a legitimate right to bring their claims and that their allegations aligned with the principles established in the landmark *Olmstead* Supreme Court decision. This precedent mandates community placement for individuals with disabilities when community placement is appropriate, the individual does not oppose the transfer, and the placement can be reasonably accommodated by the state.\n\nThe court systematically addressed each *Olmstead* requirement based on the plaintiffs' allegations. First, it found that the plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged that community placement was appropriate, noting that even those frequently institutionalized were there due to a lack of community-based alternatives, not because their conditions inherently demanded institutionalization. The court also recognized that *Olmstead* covered those at serious risk of institutionalization. Second, the court clarified that *Olmstead* did not require a minor's custodian to request community placement; rather, the plaintiffs' own alleged desire for community-based services met this prong. Third, the court determined that the plaintiffs had adequately alleged that their placement in the community could be reasonably accommodated, deeming inquiries into the state's existing plans unnecessary at this early stage. Finally, the court rejected the state's argument that prior individual state court hearings barred this federal lawsuit, emphasizing that those hearings focused on individual placements, whereas this case addressed systemic failures in the state's provision of care. The legal battle continues, with the core issues of systemic segregation now set to be fully litigated.",
