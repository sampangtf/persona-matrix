        "summary": "<p>This lawsuit was brought by several homeless people with mental and physical disabilities against the City of Laguna Beach in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The plaintiffs, represented by the Southern California chapter of the ACLU and private counsel, accused the city and the Laguna Beach Police Department (LBPD) of violating the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. § 12132), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (RA) (29 U.S.C. §§ 706, 794), and Article I, sections 7 and 17 of the California Constitution by targeting disabled homeless people under laws restricting camping in public spaces. The plaintiffs argued that the Alternative Sleeping Location (ASL), a small emergency shelter created by the county as part of the settlement of a previous lawsuit, did not provide adequate accommodations for homeless persons with disabilities, leaving them with no viable alternative to camping in public spaces. The plaintiffs brought their suit under 42 U.S.C. §1983, the Declaratory Judgement Act (28 U.S.C. §2201), and California law. They sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, declaratory relief, nominal damages, and attorneys’ fees. More specifically, the plaintiffs sought a declaration that the city was violating the law and an injunction preventing the city from enforcing anti-camping laws and requiring that the city provide new accommodations suitable for housing homeless people with disabilities. </p><p>On November 23, 2015, the plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction that would prevent the LBPD from enforcing anti-camping laws against disabled homeless people pending the final outcome of the suit. Judge Andrew J. Guilford denied the plaintiffs' motion on February 10, 2016, finding that the plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief were unlikely to succeed at trial. </p><p>On May 4, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint in order to introduce additional plaintiffs. Shortly thereafter, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification.</p><p>On October 31, 2016, both parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The plaintiffs moved for summary judgment to establish that the defendants violated (1) the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments and analogous provisions of the California Constitution, and (2) Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the RA. The defendants moved for summary judgment on all of the plaintiffs’ claims. On June 25, 2017, Judge Guilford granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the Eighth Amendment cruel and unusual punishment claims and the substantive due process claims. Judge Guilford denied both parties' motions for summary judgment on the ADA and RA claims. </p><p>On June 23, 2017, Judge Guilford granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification in part, only with respect to the plaintiffs' remaining ADA and RA claims. The named plaintiffs represented a class consisting of \"[a]ll homeless persons who reside or will reside in the geographic area of Laguna Beach who have a mental and/or physical disability as defined under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Americans with Disabilities Act and who have been, or are likely to be, cited for violations of California Penal Code section 647(e), Laguna Beach Municipal Code section 8.30.030 and/or Laguna Beach Municipal Code section 18.05.020.\"</p><p>Following nearly a year of settlement negotiations, during which the parties exchanged voluminous discovery and engaged multiple experts, the parties agreed to settle all claims in the lawsuit and filed a motion for preliminary approval of their proposed settlement agreement with the court on June 6, 2018. Under the terms of the Class Claims Settlement Agreement, the Laguna Beach City Council will adopt a resolution affirming its commitment to end homelessness in the City of Laguna Beach. Additionally, the City agreed to a number of measures designed to accommodate disabled persons experiencing homelessness in Laguna Beach. Such measures include, for instance, the continued designation of a full-time City employee to serve as the City’s “ADA Coordinator;” the adaptation of existing grievance procedures to more directly address the needs of ASL guests; the permanent posting of a Reasonable Accommodations Notice at the ASL explaining the process for requesting and obtaining reasonable accommodations; and more. The plaintiffs' counsel did not seek attorneys' fees. </p><p>On October 23, 2018, the parties filed a motion for final approval of their settlement agreement. Judge Guilford approved the motion on November 5, 2020. The court retains jurisdiction to enforce the settlement. </p>",

              "transformed_text": "This lawsuit was brought by several homeless people with mental and physical disabilities against the City of Laguna Beach in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Represented by the Southern California chapter of the ACLU and private counsel, plaintiffs accused the city and the Laguna Beach Police Department (LBPD) of violating the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. § 12132), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (RA) (29 U.S.C. §§ 706, 794), and Article I, sections 7 and 17 of the California Constitution by targeting disabled homeless people under laws restricting public camping. Plaintiffs argued the Alternative Sleeping Location (ASL), an emergency shelter created by the county from a previous settlement, did not adequately accommodate disabled homeless persons, leaving no viable alternative to public camping. The suit was brought under 42 U.S.C. §1983, the Declaratory Judgement Act (28 U.S.C. §2201), and California law. Plaintiffs sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, declaratory relief, nominal damages, and attorneys’ fees, specifically requesting a declaration of illegality and an injunction preventing anti-camping law enforcement while requiring new, suitable accommodations for disabled homeless individuals.\n\nOn November 23, 2015, plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to prevent LBPD from enforcing anti-camping laws against disabled homeless people pending suit outcome. Judge Andrew J. Guilford denied the motion on February 10, 2016, finding injunctive relief claims unlikely to succeed.\n\nPlaintiffs filed a second amended complaint to introduce additional plaintiffs, and subsequently moved for class certification.\n\nBoth parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Plaintiffs sought summary judgment to establish defendants violated (1) the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments' prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment and analogous California constitutional provisions, and (2) Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the RA. Defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims. On June 25, 2017, Judge Guilford granted defendants' motion on the Eighth Amendment cruel and unusual punishment and substantive due process claims, but denied both parties' motions on the ADA and RA claims.\n\nOn June 23, 2017, Judge Guilford granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification in part, limited to the remaining ADA and RA claims. The named plaintiffs represented a class of \"[a]ll homeless persons who reside or will reside in the geographic area of Laguna Beach who have a mental and/or physical disability as defined under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Americans with Disabilities Act and who have been, or are likely to be, cited for violations of California Penal Code section 647(e), Laguna Beach Municipal Code section 8.30.030 and/or Laguna Beach Municipal Code section 18.05.020.\"\n\nFollowing nearly a year of settlement negotiations, including voluminous discovery and expert engagement, the parties agreed to settle all claims and filed a motion for preliminary approval of their proposed settlement agreement. Under the Class Claims Settlement Agreement, the Laguna Beach City Council will adopt a resolution affirming its commitment to end homelessness in the City. The City also agreed to measures accommodating disabled homeless persons, including designating a full-time ADA Coordinator, adapting grievance procedures for ASL guests, and permanently posting a Reasonable Accommodations Notice at the ASL explaining the request process. Plaintiffs' counsel did not seek attorneys' fees.\n\nThe parties filed a motion for final approval of their settlement agreement. Judge Guilford approved the motion on November 5, 2020. The court retains jurisdiction to enforce the settlement.",

              "text": "<p>This lawsuit was brought by several homeless people with mental and physical disabilities against the City of Laguna Beach in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The plaintiffs, represented by the Southern California chapter of the ACLU and private counsel, accused the city and the Laguna Beach Police Department (LBPD) of violating the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. § 12132), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (RA) (29 U.S.C. §§ 706, 794), and Article I, sections 7 and 17 of the California Constitution by targeting disabled homeless people under laws restricting camping in public spaces. The plaintiffs argued that the Alternative Sleeping Location (ASL), a small emergency shelter created by the county as part of the settlement of a previous lawsuit, did not provide adequate accommodations for homeless persons with disabilities, leaving them with no viable alternative to camping in public spaces. The plaintiffs brought their suit under 42 U.S.C. §1983, the Declaratory Judgement Act (28 U.S.C. §2201), and California law. They sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, declaratory relief, nominal damages, and attorneys’ fees. More specifically, the plaintiffs sought a declaration that the city was violating the law and an injunction preventing the city from enforcing anti-camping laws and requiring that the city provide new accommodations suitable for housing homeless people with disabilities. </p><p>On November 23, 2015, the plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction that would prevent the LBPD from enforcing anti-camping laws against disabled homeless people pending the final outcome of the suit. Judge Andrew J. Guilford denied the plaintiffs' motion on February 10, 2016, finding that the plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief were unlikely to succeed at trial. </p><p>On May 4, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint in order to introduce additional plaintiffs. Shortly thereafter, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification.</p><p>On October 31, 2016, both parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The plaintiffs moved for summary judgment to establish that the defendants violated (1) the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments and analogous provisions of the California Constitution, and (2) Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the RA.

              "transformed_text": "This lawsuit was filed by several homeless people with mental and physical disabilities against the City of Laguna Beach in a federal court in California. The plaintiffs, represented by the Southern California ACLU and private lawyers, claimed the city and its police department (LBPD) broke several laws. They argued the city violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Rehabilitation Act (RA), and parts of the California Constitution. Their main point was that the city targeted disabled homeless people through laws that banned camping in public areas. The plaintiffs argued that the Alternative Sleeping Location (ASL), a small emergency shelter set up by the county after an earlier lawsuit, did not properly accommodate homeless people with disabilities. This left them with no real choice but to camp in public spaces. The plaintiffs filed their case using specific federal laws (like 42 U.S.C. §1983 and the Declaratory Judgment Act) and California state law. They asked the court for several things: temporary and permanent orders to stop the city's actions (injunctive relief), a formal statement from the court about the law (declaratory relief), small damages, and their legal fees. More specifically, they wanted the court to declare that the city was breaking the law. They also sought an order to prevent the city from enforcing anti-camping laws and to make the city provide suitable new housing options for disabled homeless people.\n\nOn November 23, 2015, the plaintiffs asked for a temporary court order (a preliminary injunction) to stop the LBPD from enforcing anti-camping laws against disabled homeless people while the lawsuit was ongoing. Judge Andrew J. Guilford denied this request on February 10, 2016. He found that the plaintiffs' arguments for this temporary order were unlikely to win at a full trial.\n\nOn May 4, 2016, the plaintiffs filed an updated complaint to add more plaintiffs to the case. Soon after, the plaintiffs asked the court to certify the case as a class action.\n\nOn October 31, 2016, both sides filed motions asking the judge to rule in their favor without a full trial (summary judgment). The plaintiffs' motion aimed to prove that the defendants violated laws against cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments (and similar parts of the California Constitution), as well as the ADA and RA. The defendants, on the other hand, asked for summary judgment on all of the plaintiffs' claims, seeking to dismiss them. On June 25, 2017, Judge Guilford sided with the defendants on some points, granting their request to dismiss the cruel and unusual punishment claims (under the Eighth Amendment) and the substantive due process claims. However, he denied both sides' requests for summary judgment regarding the ADA and RA claims, meaning those claims would proceed.\n\nOn June 23, 2017, Judge Guilford partially approved the plaintiffs' request for class certification, but only for the remaining ADA and RA claims. The named plaintiffs would represent a group (a class) of \"all homeless persons in Laguna Beach who have a mental or physical disability, as defined by the Rehabilitation Act and Americans with Disabilities Act, and who have been, or might be, cited for violating specific anti-camping laws (California Penal Code section 647(e) and Laguna Beach Municipal Code sections 8.30.030 and 18.05.020).\"\n\nAfter nearly a year of settlement talks, where both sides shared a lot of information and brought in many experts, the parties agreed to settle all parts of the lawsuit.

The people who sued, called \"plaintiffs,\" were helped by the ACLU (a group that protects civil rights) and other lawyers. They said the city and its police department broke several important laws. They argued the city violated parts of the U.S. Constitution: the Eighth Amendment (which protects against cruel and unusual punishment, like how the police treat people) and the Fourteenth Amendment (which says everyone deserves fair treatment and equal protection under the law). They also said the city broke laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act (RA), which are designed to protect people with disabilities, and even parts of California's own Constitution. Their main point was that the city's laws, which banned camping in public places, unfairly targeted homeless people who had disabilities. The plaintiffs argued that a special shelter called the Alternative Sleeping Location (ASL), which was set up after an earlier lawsuit, wasn't good enough for homeless people with disabilities. This meant they had no real option but to camp outside in public. They brought their case using federal laws that let people sue the government when their civil rights are violated, and also to ask a court to clearly state what the law means. They also used California state law. They asked the court to order the city to stop its actions, both temporarily and permanently. They also wanted the court to officially say the city was breaking the law, give them a small amount of money for damages, and make the city pay for their lawyers' fees. They specifically wanted the court to stop the city from enforcing its anti-camping laws and to make the city provide suitable new housing options for disabled homeless people.\n\nOn November 23, 2015, the plaintiffs asked the court for a temporary order, like a \"pause button,\" to stop the police from enforcing anti-camping laws against disabled homeless people while the lawsuit was still going on. Judge Andrew J. Guilford said \"no\" to this request on February 10, 2016. He felt that the plaintiffs' arguments for this temporary \"pause button\" probably wouldn't win if the case went to a full trial.\n\nOn May 4, 2016, the plaintiffs changed their lawsuit papers to include more people who were also suing the city. Soon after, the plaintiffs asked the court to let their case be a \"class action.\" This means one lawsuit could represent a whole group of people who had similar problems with the city, like a team representing many players.\n\nOn October 31, 2016, both sides asked the judge to make a decision in their favor without having a full trial. This is called \"summary judgment,\" like asking the teacher for a final grade based on your work so far, without needing a big final exam. The plaintiffs tried to show that the city broke laws against cruel and unusual punishment (from the U.S. Constitution's Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments and similar California laws), and also the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act (RA). The city, on the other hand, asked the judge to dismiss *all* of the plaintiffs' claims, saying they had no case. On June 25, 2017, Judge Guilford agreed with the city on some points. He dismissed the claims about cruel and unusual punishment (Eighth Amendment) and the claims about their basic rights to fair treatment. But he said 'no' to both sides' requests about the ADA and RA claims, meaning those parts of the lawsuit would continue.\n\nOn June 23, 2017, Judge Guilford partly agreed to the plaintiffs' request for a \"class action,\" but only for the remaining claims about the ADA and RA. The main plaintiffs would now represent a larger group, or \"class,\" of \"all homeless people in Laguna Beach with a mental or physical disability, as defined by the Rehabilitation Act and Americans with Disabilities Act, who have been, or could be, ticketed for breaking specific anti-camping laws.\"\n\nAfter almost a year of talks, where both sides shared lots of information and brought in many experts, everyone involved agreed to settle the entire lawsuit. They filed a request with the court on June 6, 2018, asking for initial approval of the agreement they had worked out. Under the agreement, called the Class Claims Settlement Agreement, the Laguna Beach City Council promised to officially commit to ending homelessness in the city. Also, the City agreed to several actions to help disabled homeless people in Laguna Beach. These steps included, for example, keeping a full-time city employee as the \"ADA Coordinator\" (someone who helps make sure the city follows disability laws), changing how people can complain to better help those staying at the ASL shelter, and putting up a permanent notice at the ASL explaining how to ask for and get special help or changes (called \"reasonable accommodations\"). The lawyers for the homeless people did not ask for their legal fees.\n\nOn October 23, 2018, both sides asked the court for final approval of their settlement agreement. Judge Guilford gave his final approval on November 5, 2020. The court will keep an eye on the settlement to make sure everyone follows the agreement.",

              "transformed_text": "Some homeless people with disabilities sued the City of Laguna Beach. They went to a special court in California. These people were helped by a group called the ACLU. This group helps protect people's rights. Other lawyers helped too.\n\nThey said the city and its police broke some important rules. They said the city broke parts of the U.S. Constitution, which is like the country's main rulebook. One part says police can't treat people in a cruel way. Another part says everyone should be treated fairly and equally by the law. They also said the city broke laws like the ADA and RA. These laws protect people with disabilities. They even said the city broke some of California's own rules.\n\nThe main problem was the city had rules against sleeping outside. The homeless people said these rules were unfair to them because they had disabilities. There was a special shelter called ASL. It was made after another lawsuit. But the homeless people said it wasn't good enough for people with disabilities. So, they had no choice but to sleep outside.\n\nThey used special laws that let people sue the government if their rights are broken. They also wanted the court to say clearly what the rules meant. They used California's own rules too. They asked the court to tell the city to stop what it was doing. They wanted it to stop for a little while and then forever. They also wanted the court to say the city broke the rules. They asked for a small amount of money. And they wanted the city to pay for their lawyers. They really wanted the city to stop using its anti-camping rules. And they wanted the city to find good new places for homeless people with disabilities to live.\n\nOn November 23, 2015, the homeless people asked the court for a \"pause button.\" They wanted the police to stop using the anti-camping rules against disabled homeless people. They wanted this pause while the lawsuit was still happening. But on February 10, 2016, the judge, Andrew J. Guilford, said \"no.\" He thought their reasons for the \"pause button\" probably wouldn't win if the case went to a full trial.\n\nOn May 4, 2016, the homeless people changed their lawsuit papers. They added more people who were also suing the city. Soon after, they asked the court to make their case a \"class action.\" This means one lawsuit could speak for many people. It's like a team playing for a whole group of players who had the same problem with the city.\n\nOn October 31, 2016, both sides asked the judge to decide the case without a full trial. This is called \"summary judgment.\" It's like asking your teacher for a final grade early, without taking a big final test. The homeless people tried to show the city broke rules about cruel treatment. These rules are in the U.S. Constitution and California laws. They also said the city broke the ADA and RA laws. The city, though, asked the judge to throw out *all* the homeless people's claims. They said the homeless people had no case.\n\nOn June 25, 2017, Judge Guilford agreed with the city on some things. He threw out the claims about cruel treatment. He also threw out claims about their basic rights to fair treatment. But he said 'no' to both sides about the ADA and RA claims. This meant those parts of the lawsuit would keep going.\n\nOn June 23, 2017, Judge Guilford partly agreed to the \"class action\" idea. But it was only for the ADA and RA claims that were still left. The main homeless people would now speak for a bigger group. This group included \"all homeless people in Laguna Beach with a mental or physical disability. These were people who had been, or could be, given tickets for breaking certain anti-camping rules.\"\n\nFor almost a year, both sides talked a lot. They shared information and brought in many experts. Finally, everyone agreed to end the whole lawsuit. On June 6, 2018, they asked the court to first approve their agreement. In the agreement, the Laguna Beach City Council promised to work toward ending homelessness in the city. The City also agreed to do many things to help disabled homeless people in Laguna Beach.\n\nFor example, they would keep a full-time city worker called the \"ADA Coordinator.\" This person helps make sure the city follows laws for people with disabilities. They would also change how people can complain to help those at the ASL shelter better. And they would put up a sign at the ASL. This sign would explain how to ask for special help or changes. The lawyers for the homeless people did not ask for money for their work.\n\nOn October 23, 2018, both sides asked the court to finally approve their agreement. Judge Guilford said 'yes' for the last time on November 5, 2020. The court will watch to make sure everyone follows the agreement.",

              "text": "<p>This lawsuit was brought by several homeless people with mental and physical disabilities against the City of Laguna Beach in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The plaintiffs, represented by the Southern California chapter of the ACLU and private counsel, accused the city and the Laguna Beach Police Department (LBPD) of violating the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. § 12132), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (RA) (29 U.S.C. §§ 706, 794), and Article I, sections 7 and 17 of the California Constitution by targeting disabled homeless people under laws restricting camping in public spaces. The plaintiffs argued that the Alternative Sleeping Location (ASL), a small emergency shelter created by the county as part of the settlement of a previous lawsuit, did not provide adequate accommodations for homeless persons with disabilities, leaving them with no viable alternative to camping in public spaces. The plaintiffs brought their suit under 42 U.S.C. §1983, the Declaratory Judgement Act (28 U.S.C. §2201), and California law. They sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, declaratory relief, nominal damages, and attorneys’ fees. More specifically, the plaintiffs sought a declaration that the city was violating the law and an injunction preventing the city from enforcing anti-camping laws and requiring that the city provide new accommodations suitable for housing homeless people with disabilities. </p><p>On November 23, 2015, the plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction that would prevent the LBPD from enforcing anti-camping laws against disabled homeless people pending the final outcome of the suit. Judge Andrew J. Guilford denied the plaintiffs' motion on February 10, 2016, finding that the plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief were unlikely to succeed at trial. </p><p>On May 4, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint in order to introduce additional plaintiffs. Shortly thereafter, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification.</p><p>On October 31, 2016, both parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The plaintiffs moved for summary judgment to establish that the defendants violated (1) the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments and analogous provisions of the California Constitution, and (2) Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the RA. The defendants moved for summary judgment on all of the plaintiffs’ claims. On June 25, 2017, Judge Guilford granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the Eighth Amendment cruel and unusual punishment claims and the substantive due process claims. Judge Guilford denied both parties' motions for summary judgment on the ADA and RA claims. </p><p>On June 23, 2017, Judge Guilford granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification in part, only with respect to the plaintiffs' remaining ADA and RA claims. The named plaintiffs represented a class consisting of \"[a]ll homeless persons who reside or will reside in the geographic area of Laguna Beach who have a mental and/or physical disability as defined under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Americans with Disabilities Act and who have been, or are likely to be, cited for violations of California Penal Code section 647(e), Laguna Beach Municipal Code section 8.30.030 and/or Laguna Beach Municipal Code section 18.05.020.\"</p><p>Following nearly a year of settlement negotiations, during which the parties exchanged voluminous discovery and engaged multiple experts, the parties agreed to settle all claims in the lawsuit and filed a motion for preliminary approval of their proposed settlement agreement with the court on June 6, 2018. Under the terms of the Class Claims Settlement Agreement, the Laguna Beach City Council will adopt a resolution affirming its commitment to end homelessness in the City of Laguna Beach. Additionally, the City agreed to a number of measures designed to accommodate disabled persons experiencing homelessness in Laguna Beach. Such measures include, for instance, the continued designation of a full-time City employee to serve as the City’s “ADA Coordinator;” the adaptation of existing grievance procedures to more directly address the needs of ASL guests; the permanent posting of a Reasonable Accommodations Notice at the ASL explaining the process for requesting and obtaining reasonable accommodations; and more. The plaintiffs' counsel did not seek attorneys' fees. </p><p>On October 23, 2018, the parties filed a motion for final approval of their settlement agreement. Judge Guilford approved the motion on November 5, 2020. The court retains jurisdiction to enforce the settlement. </p>",

              "transformed_text": "This historical account begins with a group of homeless individuals, many with mental and physical disabilities, who initiated a legal challenge against the City of Laguna Beach and its Police Department. Their purpose in bringing this suit was clear: they contended that the city's enforcement of anti-camping laws disproportionately targeted them, violating their fundamental rights under both the U.S. and California Constitutions, as well as federal disability protection laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act (RA). They argued that the city's existing emergency shelter, the Alternative Sleeping Location (ASL), was insufficient to meet the needs of disabled individuals, leaving them with no lawful alternative to public camping. Through this action, they sought not only a declaration that the city's practices were illegal but also an order to halt these enforcements and compel the city to provide truly accessible accommodations.\n\nEarly in the proceedings, the plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction, a strategic move to immediately prevent the police from enforcing anti-camping laws against disabled homeless people while the case unfolded. However, the court denied this request, signaling that the plaintiffs had not yet demonstrated a strong enough likelihood of prevailing on their claims to warrant such an immediate, drastic measure.\n\nRecognizing the need to broaden their collective voice, the plaintiffs later amended their complaint to include additional individuals and then sought to certify their case as a class action. This strategic decision aimed to allow the lawsuit to proceed on behalf of a larger group of similarly situated disabled homeless individuals, significantly expanding the potential impact of any favorable outcome.\n\nAs the litigation progressed, both sides sought summary judgment, a maneuver to resolve parts or all of the case without a full trial. The plaintiffs hoped to secure a ruling that the city had undeniably violated constitutional and disability rights, while the defendants aimed for a complete dismissal of all claims against them. The court, however, delivered a mixed outcome: it sided with the city on the constitutional claims related to cruel and unusual punishment and due process, but determined that the core disability rights claims under the ADA and RA still presented genuine issues requiring further examination.\n\nCrucially, the court did grant the plaintiffs' request for class certification, though specifically for their remaining ADA and RA claims. This meant that the lawsuit could now proceed representing a defined group of disabled homeless individuals in Laguna Beach who had been, or were likely to be, cited under the contested anti-camping laws.\n\nAfter nearly a year of intense negotiations, the parties decided to pursue a settlement, recognizing the complexities and costs of a prolonged legal battle. This agreement offered a path to a resolution that addressed the plaintiffs' concerns without the uncertainty of a trial. Under the terms, the City of Laguna Beach committed to a resolution affirming its dedication to ending homelessness and, more specifically, agreed to implement various measures to better accommodate disabled homeless individuals. These included appointing an ADA Coordinator, improving grievance procedures at the ASL, and publicly posting information about reasonable accommodations. Notably, the plaintiffs' counsel chose not to seek attorneys' fees, underscoring their focus on the substantive changes for the community.\n\nThe settlement received final judicial approval, bringing a definitive end to the dispute. The court retained jurisdiction, ensuring its ability to oversee the city's compliance with the agreed-upon terms.",

That was the harsh reality for many homeless individuals in Laguna Beach. They found themselves targeted by anti-camping rules, yet the city's emergency shelter, meant to offer a refuge, simply wasn't equipped to meet their unique needs, leaving them with no lawful place to reside.\n\n**The Fight:** Feeling unfairly treated and with no other options, these individuals decided to seek help to change things. They argued that their rights were being ignored, specifically because of their disabilities, and that the city's actions were unfair.\n\n**The Resolution:** Their determination led to a major commitment from the City of Laguna Beach. Through a comprehensive agreement, the city has now promised to make significant changes to better support its disabled homeless residents. This includes appointing a dedicated person to help with accessibility and improving how people can voice their concerns at the shelter, finally providing the accessible alternatives they had long sought. In a powerful gesture, those who helped them chose not to seek payment, emphasizing that their true goal was to achieve meaningful community change rather than financial gain. This resolution now ensures the city is responsible for providing accessible accommodations, setting an important example for supporting vulnerable populations.",

He sued New York State&rsquo;s Commissioner of Corrections and the Wardens of Auburn and Clinton Prisons under &sect;1983 a few days after he was allegedly beaten in the Segregation Unit at Clinton Prison, by a squad of seven or more officers, when he refused to bend over and spread his buttocks to exhibit his anus to them in the course of a strip search. The Complaint asserted seventeen separate causes of action, including wrongful punishment and indefinite confinement to segregation, wrongful application of the no-beard rule, wrongful imposition of the rectal search, wrongful denial of visits from attorneys, clergy and friends, interference with mail, and wrongful punitive transfer from Auburn to Clinton. Sostre sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and money damages.</p>\r\n<p>On September 14, 1973, Judge Edmund Port entered an order finding the complaint sufficient in law to permit the plaintiff to proceed in forma pauperis. The case then lay dormant in the Northern District for sixteen months until Sostre was able to obtain counsel; starting February, 1975, he was represented by radical prisoners&rsquo; rights lawyers Michael Deutsch and Dennis Cunningham.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Once Sostre obtained counsel, the Court agreed to hear his motion for preliminary relief, and entered an order directing that the plaintiff be brought into federal custody so he would not again have to face the forcible search and re-confinement to the Segregation Unit. On March 4 and 5, 1975, a hearing was held pertaining to Sostre&rsquo;s request for preliminary relief. That request included that the defendants be enjoined from (1) enforcing a rule or regulation prohibiting inmates at Clinton Correctional Facility from wearing a beard; (2) continuing to punish plaintiff for violating the no-beard rule or regulation; and (3) requiring the plaintiff to submit to a rectal search upon entering and leaving a Special Housing Unit at Clinton Correctional Facility.</p>\r\n<p>The district court denied preliminary relief, finding that plaintiff failed to show likely success on the merits and irreparable injury. Judge Port ordered Sostre returned to the custody of the Clinton Prison. However, this order was stayed, with the agreement of defendants, pending disposition of plaintiff's appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</p>\r\n<p>On June 19, 1975, the appeals court reversed the district court's denial of preliminary relief and remanded the matter to the district court. In an opinion written by Judge Oakes, the Second Circuit concluded that it could not rule on the relief sought because the record did not establish what the \"no-beard\" and \"rectal search\" rules, if they were such, required. Without knowing what the rules said, the court determined it could not ascertain whether the rules had been properly applied. It remanded the case to the district court for record development and re-evaluation. The opinion, however, reaffirmed that prison inmates are entitled to certain fundamental rights, and stated that limitations on such rights \"must be supported by the legitimate and reasonable needs and exigencies of the institutional environment,\" and that these limitations must be narrowly tailored. The opinion also stated that the district court would not be amiss were it to continue the stay order in effect to keep plaintiff in federal custody. 519 F.2d 763</p>\r\n<p>By this time, Sostre had gained international news media attention and been labeled as a \"prisoner of conscience\" by Amnesty International. In December 1975, New York's governor Hugh Carey granted Sostre clemency, and he was released from custody.

He sued the New York State Commissioner of Corrections and the Wardens of Auburn and Clinton Prisons. The lawsuit followed an alleged beating in Clinton Prison's Segregation Unit after Sostre refused a rectal strip search. His seventeen-count Complaint asserted claims including wrongful punishment and indefinite segregation, wrongful application of the no-beard rule, improper rectal search, denial of attorney, clergy, and friend visits, mail interference, and wrongful punitive transfer from Auburn to Clinton. Sostre sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and money damages.\n\nOn September 14, 1973, Judge Edmund Port entered an order finding the complaint sufficient in law to permit Sostre to proceed in forma pauperis. The case remained dormant for sixteen months until Sostre secured counsel, Michael Deutsch and Dennis Cunningham, in February 1975.\n\nUpon obtaining counsel, Sostre moved for preliminary relief. The Court ordered his transfer to federal custody to prevent further forcible searches and re-confinement to the Segregation Unit. A hearing was held regarding Sostre’s request, which sought to enjoin defendants from enforcing the no-beard rule, punishing him for its violation, and requiring rectal searches upon entering or leaving a Special Housing Unit at Clinton Correctional Facility.\n\nThe district court denied preliminary relief, finding Sostre failed to show likely success on the merits and irreparable injury. Judge Port ordered Sostre returned to the custody of Clinton Prison.

The appellate court concluded it could not rule on the relief sought without a clear record establishing the specific requirements of the \"no-beard\" and \"rectal search\" rules, and thus could not ascertain whether the rules had been properly applied. It remanded the case to the district court for record development and re-evaluation.

He sued the New York State Commissioner of Corrections and the Wardens of Auburn and Clinton Prisons. The lawsuit followed an alleged beating in Clinton Prison's Segregation Unit after Sostre refused a rectal strip search. His seventeen-count Complaint asserted claims including wrongful punishment and indefinite segregation, wrongful application of the no-beard rule, improper rectal search, denial of attorney, clergy, and friend visits, mail interference, and wrongful punitive transfer from Auburn to Clinton. Sostre sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and money damages.\n\nAfter the complaint was found sufficient in law to permit Sostre to proceed in forma pauperis, the case remained dormant for sixteen months until Sostre secured counsel in February 1975.\n\nUpon obtaining counsel, Sostre moved for preliminary relief. The Court ordered his transfer to federal custody to prevent further forcible searches and re-confinement to the Segregation Unit. A hearing was held regarding Sostre’s request, which sought to enjoin defendants from enforcing the no-beard rule, punishing him for its violation, and requiring rectal searches upon entering or leaving a Special Housing Unit at Clinton Correctional Facility.\n\nThe district court denied preliminary relief, finding Sostre failed to show likely success on the merits and irreparable injury. Judge Port ordered Sostre returned to the custody of Clinton Prison. However, this order was stayed, with the defendants' agreement, pending disposition of Sostre's appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n\nOn June 19, 1975, the Second Circuit, in an opinion by Judge Oakes, reversed the district court's denial of preliminary relief and remanded the matter. The appellate court concluded it could not rule on the relief sought without a clear record establishing the specific requirements of the \"no-beard\" and \"rectal search\" rules, and thus could not ascertain whether the rules had been properly applied.

He sued New York State&rsquo;s Commissioner of Corrections and the Wardens of Auburn and Clinton Prisons under &sect;1983 a few days after he was allegedly beaten in the Segregation Unit at Clinton Prison, by a squad of seven or more officers, when he refused to bend over and spread his buttocks to exhibit his anus to them in the course of a strip search. The Complaint asserted seventeen separate causes of action, including wrongful punishment and indefinite confinement to segregation, wrongful application of the no-beard rule, wrongful imposition of the rectal search, wrongful denial of visits from attorneys, clergy and friends, interference with mail, and wrongful punitive transfer from Auburn to Clinton. Sostre sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and money damages.</p>\r\n<p>On September 14, 1973, Judge Edmund Port entered an order finding the complaint sufficient in law to permit the plaintiff to proceed in forma pauperis. The case then lay dormant in the Northern District for sixteen months until Sostre was able to obtain counsel; starting February, 1975, he was represented by radical prisoners&rsquo; rights lawyers Michael Deutsch and Dennis Cunningham.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Once Sostre obtained counsel, the Court agreed to hear his motion for preliminary relief, and entered an order directing that the plaintiff be brought into federal custody so he would not again have to face the forcible search and re-confinement to the Segregation Unit. On March 4 and 5, 1975, a hearing was held pertaining to Sostre&rsquo;s request for preliminary relief. That request included that the defendants be enjoined from (1) enforcing a rule or regulation prohibiting inmates at Clinton Correctional Facility from wearing a beard; (2) continuing to punish plaintiff for violating the no-beard rule or regulation; and (3) requiring the plaintiff to submit to a rectal search upon entering and leaving a Special Housing Unit at Clinton Correctional Facility.</p>\r\n<p>The district court denied preliminary relief, finding that plaintiff failed to show likely success on the merits and irreparable injury. Judge Port ordered Sostre returned to the custody of the Clinton Prison. However, this order was stayed, with the agreement of defendants, pending disposition of plaintiff's appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</p>\r\n<p>On June 19, 1975, the appeals court reversed the district court's denial of preliminary relief and remanded the matter to the district court. In an opinion written by Judge Oakes, the Second Circuit concluded that it could not rule on the relief sought because the record did not establish what the \"no-beard\" and \"rectal search\" rules, if they were such, required. Without knowing what the rules said, the court determined it could not ascertain whether the rules had been properly applied. It remanded the case to the district court for record development and re-evaluation. The opinion, however, reaffirmed that prison inmates are entitled to certain fundamental rights, and stated that limitations on such rights \"must be supported by the legitimate and reasonable needs and exigencies of the institutional environment,\" and that these limitations must be narrowly tailored. The opinion also stated that the district court would not be amiss were it to continue the stay order in effect to keep plaintiff in federal custody. 519 F.2d 763</p>\r\n<p>By this time, Sostre had gained international news media attention and been labeled as a \"prisoner of conscience\" by Amnesty International. In December 1975, New York's governor Hugh Carey granted Sostre clemency, and he was released from custody. Presumably, this case was mooted as a result; federal records show that the case officially ended on Jan. 18, 1978.</p>",

It is part of the Clearinghouse's collection of several cases brought by the well-known prisoners' rights advocate (and prisoner) Martin Sostre, whose Wikipedia biography is available online.\n\nOn September 18, 1973, Sostre filed this lawsuit on his own behalf in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York. He sued New York State's Commissioner of Corrections and the Wardens of Auburn and Clinton Prisons, claiming they violated his civil rights under a specific federal law (Section 1983). This happened a few days after he was allegedly beaten in the isolation unit at Clinton Prison by a group of seven or more officers. This occurred when he refused to submit to a strip search that required him to expose his anus. His lawsuit listed seventeen separate claims, including unfair punishment and indefinite confinement to isolation, unfair enforcement of the no-beard rule, unfair requirement of a rectal search, unfair denial of visits from his lawyers, religious leaders, and friends, interference with his mail, and an unfair transfer as punishment from Auburn to Clinton. Sostre asked the court to declare his rights, order the prison to stop certain actions, and pay him money for damages.\n\nOn September 14, 1973, Judge Edmund Port issued an order allowing Sostre to proceed with his lawsuit without paying court fees, as he was unable to afford them. The case then remained inactive in the Northern District for sixteen months until Sostre found legal representation. Starting in February 1975, he was represented by Michael Deutsch and Dennis Cunningham, who were lawyers specializing in prisoners' rights.\n\nOnce Sostre had lawyers, the Court agreed to hear his request for a temporary order. It issued an order to transfer Sostre to federal custody. This was to prevent him from facing the forced search and being sent back to the isolation unit. On March 4 and 5, 1975, a hearing was held regarding Sostre's request for temporary relief. His request asked the court to order the defendants to stop: (1) enforcing a rule that stopped inmates at Clinton Correctional Facility from wearing a beard; (2) continuing to punish Sostre for breaking the no-beard rule; and (3) requiring Sostre to undergo a rectal search when entering and leaving a Special Housing Unit at Clinton Correctional Facility.\n\nThe district court denied this temporary relief. It found that Sostre had not shown he was likely to win the case or that he would suffer harm that could not be fixed later. Judge Port ordered Sostre to be sent back to Clinton Prison. However, this order was put on hold, with the defendants' agreement, until Sostre's appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was decided.\n\nOn June 19, 1975, the appeals court overturned the district court's decision to deny temporary relief and sent the case back to the district court. In an opinion by Judge Oakes, the Second Circuit decided it could not rule on the requested relief. This was because the court records did not clearly show what the \"no-beard\" and \"rectal search\" rules, if they existed, actually required. Without knowing the exact rules, the court could not tell if they had been applied correctly. It sent the case back to the district court to gather more facts and reconsider the matter. However, the opinion confirmed that prisoners have certain basic rights. It stated that any limits on these rights \"must be based on the valid and practical needs of the prison setting,\" and that these limits must be carefully designed to be as minimal as possible. The opinion also suggested that the district court would be right to keep the stay order in place, allowing Sostre to remain in federal custody. 519 F.2d 763\n\nBy this time, Sostre had gained international news media attention and been labeled a \"prisoner of conscience\" by Amnesty International. In December 1975, New York's Governor Hugh Carey granted Sostre clemency, which led to his release from prison. This likely made the case irrelevant, as Sostre was no longer in prison.

It is one of several cases brought by the well-known prisoner rights activist Martin Sostre.\n\nOn September 18, 1973, Sostre filed this lawsuit himself in federal court in Northern New York. He sued New York State's Commissioner of Corrections and the heads of Auburn and Clinton Prisons. He claimed they violated his civil rights under a federal law known as Section 1983, which allows people to sue government officials who violate their constitutional rights. This happened a few days after he was allegedly beaten in a prison isolation unit by several officers. This occurred when he refused a strip search that required him to expose his anus. His lawsuit listed 17 separate complaints. These included unfair punishment and being kept in isolation indefinitely, unfair enforcement of a no-beard rule, being forced to undergo a rectal search, being denied visits from his lawyers, religious leaders, and friends, interference with his mail, and an unfair transfer as punishment from Auburn to Clinton. Sostre asked the court to officially state his rights, order the prison to stop certain actions, and award him money for damages.\n\nOn September 14, 1973, Judge Edmund Port allowed Sostre to proceed with his lawsuit without paying court fees, as he could not afford them. The case then remained on hold for 16 months until Sostre found lawyers.

It's one of several cases brought by the well-known activist Martin Sostre, who fought for the rights of prisoners.\n\nOn September 18, 1973, Sostre, acting as his own lawyer, started this lawsuit in a federal court in Northern New York. He sued the person in charge of all New York State prisons and the wardens (heads) of Auburn and Clinton Prisons. He said they violated his civil rights, which are basic freedoms protected by the Constitution. He sued them using a federal law called Section 1983, which lets people take government officials to court if those officials break their constitutional rights. Think of it like a special rule that allows you to hold government workers accountable if they overstep. This happened a few days after he was supposedly beaten by several officers in a special isolation unit (like solitary confinement) in prison. This occurred when he refused a strip search where he had to show his anus. His lawsuit listed 17 different complaints. These included unfair punishment, being held in isolation for too long, unfairly being forced to follow a rule against having a beard, being forced to have a rectal search, not being allowed to see his lawyers, religious leaders, or friends, his mail being messed with, and being unfairly moved as punishment from Auburn Prison to Clinton Prison. Sostre asked the court to clearly state what his rights were, order the prison to stop doing certain things, and pay him money for the harm he suffered.\n\nOn September 14, 1973, Judge Edmund Port allowed Sostre to move forward with his lawsuit without having to pay court fees, because he couldn't afford them. This is like getting a waiver for a school fee if you can't pay. The case then paused for 16 months until Sostre found lawyers. Starting in February 1975, two lawyers named Michael Deutsch and Dennis Cunningham, who focused on prisoner rights, began representing him.\n\nOnce Sostre had lawyers, the court agreed to hear his request for a temporary order, which is like asking for a quick fix while the main case is still going on. The court ordered Sostre to be moved into federal custody (meaning he was held by the federal government, not the state prison). This was to keep him from facing the forced search again and being sent back to the isolation unit. On March 4 and 5, 1975, a hearing (a formal meeting in court) was held about Sostre's request for this temporary help. He asked the prison officials to stop: (1) making prisoners at Clinton Correctional Facility follow a rule that banned beards; (2) punishing Sostre for breaking that no-beard rule; and (3) making him have a rectal search every time he entered or left a Special Housing Unit (a specific part of the prison).\n\nThe lower court (the first court to hear the case) said no to this temporary request. It said Sostre hadn't shown he was likely to win his main case, nor that he would suffer harm that couldn't be fixed later on. Judge Port ordered Sostre to be sent back to Clinton Prison. But this order was put on hold (paused), with the prison officials agreeing, until Sostre's appeal to a higher court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, was decided. Think of an appeal like asking a higher authority to review a decision you disagree with.\n\nOn June 19, 1975, the appeals court (the higher court) reversed the lower court's decision to deny temporary help. It sent the case back to the lower court to look at it again. In a written decision by Judge Oakes, the Second Circuit (the appeals court) said it couldn't make a decision on the help Sostre asked for. This was because the court's records didn't clearly show what the \"no-beard\" and \"rectal search\" rules, if they even existed, actually said or required. Without knowing the exact rules, the court couldn't tell if they had been used fairly. So, it sent the case back to the lower court to gather more information and think about the issue again. However, the appeals court's decision did confirm that people in prison still have certain basic rights. It said that any limits on these rights \"must be based on the real and practical needs of running a prison,\" and that these limits must be designed very carefully to be as small as possible. This is like a school rule: it has to have a good reason and shouldn't be more restrictive than it needs to be. The decision also suggested that the lower court would be right to keep the pause order in place, allowing Sostre to remain in federal custody.\n\nBy this time, Sostre had become known around the world, getting attention from news outlets and being called a \"prisoner of conscience\" by Amnesty International, a group that advocates for human rights. In December 1975, New York's Governor Hugh Carey gave Sostre \"clemency,\" which is like a special forgiveness that led to his release from prison. It's similar to a president pardoning someone. This probably made the case unimportant, since Sostre was no longer in prison and the issues were about his time there.

              "transformed_text": "This is an important story about people in prison in New York. It's about a man named Martin Sostre. He was a well-known person who fought for prisoners' rights.\n\nOn September 18, 1973, Sostre started a lawsuit. He was his own lawyer. He went to a federal court in New York. He sued the person in charge of all New York State prisons. He also sued the heads of Auburn and Clinton Prisons. He said they broke his basic rights. These are freedoms protected by law. He used a special federal law to sue them. This happened a few days after he was supposedly beaten. Several officers in a special prison unit beat him. This happened because he refused a strip search. He had to show his anus during the search. His lawsuit listed 17 different complaints. These included unfair punishment. He was held in isolation for too long. He was unfairly forced to follow a rule against having a beard. He was forced to have a rectal search. He was not allowed to see his lawyers, religious leaders, or friends. His mail was messed with. He was unfairly moved from Auburn Prison to Clinton Prison as punishment. Sostre asked the court to say what his rights were. He asked the court to order the prison to stop certain things. He also asked for money for the harm he suffered.\n\nOn September 14, 1973, a judge named Edmund Port helped Sostre. He let Sostre go forward with his lawsuit without paying court fees. This was because Sostre couldn't afford them. It's like getting a pass for a school fee if you don't have enough money. The case then paused for 16 months. Sostre needed to find lawyers. In February 1975, two lawyers started helping him. Their names were Michael Deutsch and Dennis Cunningham. They worked on cases for prisoners' rights.\n\nOnce Sostre had lawyers, the court agreed to hear his request. He asked for a temporary order. This is like asking for a quick fix while the main case is still happening. The court ordered Sostre to be moved. He went into federal care. This meant the federal government held him, not the state prison. This stopped him from facing the forced search again. It also stopped him from being sent back to the isolation unit. On March 4 and 5, 1975, a formal meeting was held in court. It was about Sostre's request for this temporary help. He asked the prison officials to stop three things. First, stop making prisoners at Clinton Prison follow a rule that banned beards. Second, stop punishing Sostre for breaking that no-beard rule. Third, stop making him have a rectal search every time he went in or out of a special part of the prison.\n\nThe first court to hear the case said no to this temporary request. It said Sostre hadn't shown he would likely win his main case. It also said he wouldn't suffer harm that couldn't be fixed later. Judge Port ordered Sostre to be sent back to Clinton Prison. But this order was put on hold. The prison officials agreed to this. It was paused until a higher court decided Sostre's appeal. An appeal is like asking a higher boss to look at a decision you don't agree with.\n\nOn June 19, 1975, the higher court made a decision. It was called the appeals court. It said the first court was wrong to say no to the temporary help. It sent the case back to the first court to look at again. A judge named Oakes wrote the decision. The appeals court said it couldn't decide on the help Sostre asked for. This was because the court's papers didn't clearly show what the \"no-beard\" and \"rectal search\" rules actually said. The court didn't know if these rules even existed. Without knowing the exact rules, the court couldn't tell if they were used fairly. So, it sent the case back to the first court. That court needed to gather more information. It also needed to think about the issue again. But the appeals court's decision did say something important. It confirmed that people in prison still have certain basic rights. It said that any limits on these rights must be for good reasons. These reasons must be about the real needs of running a prison. And these limits must be very small. They should not be more than needed. This is like a school rule. It has to have a good reason. It shouldn't be too strict. The decision also said it would be okay for the first court to keep Sostre in federal care.\n\nBy this time, Sostre was very well known. News groups around the world paid attention to him. Amnesty International, a group that helps human rights, called him a \"prisoner of conscience.\" In December 1975, New York's Governor Hugh Carey did something special. He gave Sostre \"clemency.\" This is like a special forgiveness. It led to Sostre being released from prison. It's similar to a president pardoning someone. Because Sostre was no longer in prison, the case probably became unimportant. The problems were about his time in prison. Official government papers show the case was formally closed on January 18, 1978.",

It's part of the Clearinghouse's <a href=\"../../../../search/case/?special_collection=5701&amp;ordering=-last_updated_date\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">collection</a> of several cases brought by prisoners rights activist (and prisoner) Martin Sostre, whose wikipedia biography is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Sostre\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 18, 1973, Sostre filed this lawsuit, pro se, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York. He sued New York State&rsquo;s Commissioner of Corrections and the Wardens of Auburn and Clinton Prisons under &sect;1983 a few days after he was allegedly beaten in the Segregation Unit at Clinton Prison, by a squad of seven or more officers, when he refused to bend over and spread his buttocks to exhibit his anus to them in the course of a strip search. The Complaint asserted seventeen separate causes of action, including wrongful punishment and indefinite confinement to segregation, wrongful application of the no-beard rule, wrongful imposition of the rectal search, wrongful denial of visits from attorneys, clergy and friends, interference with mail, and wrongful punitive transfer from Auburn to Clinton. Sostre sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and money damages.</p>\r\n<p>On September 14, 1973, Judge Edmund Port entered an order finding the complaint sufficient in law to permit the plaintiff to proceed in forma pauperis. The case then lay dormant in the Northern District for sixteen months until Sostre was able to obtain counsel; starting February, 1975, he was represented by radical prisoners&rsquo; rights lawyers Michael Deutsch and Dennis Cunningham.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Once Sostre obtained counsel, the Court agreed to hear his motion for preliminary relief, and entered an order directing that the plaintiff be brought into federal custody so he would not again have to face the forcible search and re-confinement to the Segregation Unit. On March 4 and 5, 1975, a hearing was held pertaining to Sostre&rsquo;s request for preliminary relief. That request included that the defendants be enjoined from (1) enforcing a rule or regulation prohibiting inmates at Clinton Correctional Facility from wearing a beard; (2) continuing to punish plaintiff for violating the no-beard rule or regulation; and (3) requiring the plaintiff to submit to a rectal search upon entering and leaving a Special Housing Unit at Clinton Correctional Facility.</p>\r\n<p>The district court denied preliminary relief, finding that plaintiff failed to show likely success on the merits and irreparable injury. Judge Port ordered Sostre returned to the custody of the Clinton Prison. However, this order was stayed, with the agreement of defendants, pending disposition of plaintiff's appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</p>\r\n<p>On June 19, 1975, the appeals court reversed the district court's denial of preliminary relief and remanded the matter to the district court. In an opinion written by Judge Oakes, the Second Circuit concluded that it could not rule on the relief sought because the record did not establish what the \"no-beard\" and \"rectal search\" rules, if they were such, required. Without knowing what the rules said, the court determined it could not ascertain whether the rules had been properly applied. It remanded the case to the district court for record development and re-evaluation. The opinion, however, reaffirmed that prison inmates are entitled to certain fundamental rights, and stated that limitations on such rights \"must be supported by the legitimate and reasonable needs and exigencies of the institutional environment,\" and that these limitations must be narrowly tailored. The opinion also stated that the district court would not be amiss were it to continue the stay order in effect to keep plaintiff in federal custody. 519 F.2d 763</p>\r\n<p>By this time, Sostre had gained international news media attention and been labeled as a \"prisoner of conscience\" by Amnesty International. In December 1975, New York's governor Hugh Carey granted Sostre clemency, and he was released from custody. Presumably, this case was mooted as a result; federal records show that the case officially ended on Jan. 18, 1978.</p>",

              "transformed_text": "This is a historic case about prisoner rights in New York, part of a collection of legal challenges brought by the activist and prisoner, Martin Sostre.\n\nOn September 18, 1973, Sostre launched a legal challenge on his own behalf, suing New York State’s Commissioner of Corrections and the Wardens of Auburn and Clinton Prisons. He did so just days after allegedly enduring a brutal beating in Clinton Prison's Segregation Unit, inflicted by a squad of officers when he refused a humiliating strip search. His claims encompassed seventeen distinct grievances, including wrongful punishment, indefinite solitary confinement, the arbitrary enforcement of a no-beard rule, the imposition of invasive rectal searches, denial of visits, interference with mail, and a punitive transfer. Through this lawsuit, Sostre sought not only to declare these practices unlawful and halt them, but also to secure compensation for his suffering.\n\nThe court acknowledged the gravity of his allegations, allowing him to proceed despite his lack of funds. The legal battle then paused for sixteen months, awaiting the arrival of dedicated legal representation, which he found in February 1975, when radical prisoners' rights lawyers Michael Deutsch and Dennis Cunningham joined his cause.\n\nOnce Sostre secured counsel, the court agreed to hear his urgent plea for immediate protection. Recognizing the immediate threat to his safety, it ordered his transfer into federal custody, shielding him from further punitive searches and solitary confinement. A hearing was convened in March 1975 to consider Sostre's plea for immediate intervention. His request sought to halt the prison's enforcement of its no-beard policy, end his punishment for defying it, and prevent the continued imposition of invasive rectal searches.\n\nHowever, the district court ultimately refused this immediate protection, concluding that Sostre had not yet demonstrated a high probability of winning his case or suffering irreversible harm. This decision meant Sostre was to be returned to Clinton Prison, exposing him once more to the very conditions he challenged. Yet, in a crucial turn, the defendants agreed to a stay, allowing Sostre to remain in federal custody while he pursued an appeal to the Second Circuit, buying him time and preventing his immediate return to the harsh prison environment.\n\nThe appeals court, however, intervened, overturning the lower court's refusal of immediate relief and sending the case back for further consideration. The Second Circuit, in an opinion by Judge Oakes, found itself unable to fully address Sostre's claims because the specifics of the prison's \"no-beard\" and \"rectal search\" policies were unclear in the existing record. To ensure a just decision, it directed the lower court to gather more information, allowing for a proper assessment of whether these rules were legitimate and applied fairly. Crucially, the appellate court used this opportunity to firmly reassert that prisoners retain fundamental rights, emphasizing that any restrictions on these rights must be genuinely necessary for institutional security and narrowly tailored to achieve that purpose. It also advised the district court to maintain Sostre in federal custody, acknowledging the ongoing need for his protection.\n\nWhile his legal battle continued, Sostre's plight had resonated far beyond the courtroom, earning him international media attention and the designation of \"prisoner of conscience\" by Amnesty International. Ultimately, his release came not from a court order, but from a grant of clemency by New York Governor Hugh Carey in December 1975, effectively rendering his legal fight for freedom unnecessary. Though the case formally concluded years later, his release marked the practical end of this significant chapter in prisoner rights history.",

              "transformed_text": "Washington state law SB 5375, which mandated priests report suspected child abuse or neglect disclosed in confession, faced a legal challenge. Confession, a foundational sacrament of the Catholic Church for two millennia, carries severe theological penalties, including \"eternal damnation\" and automatic excommunication, for priests who breach its confidentiality. While Washington's three Catholic dioceses already mandated reporting beyond state law, they excepted information learned exclusively via confession. Plaintiffs asserted the new state law violated the First Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause, and the Washington Constitution.\n\nEleven Catholic archbishops and priests, represented by Wilmer Hale and the Becket Fund for religious liberty, initiated the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington on May 29, 2025. They named state and county prosecuting authorities as defendants, seeking a declaration of unconstitutionality, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against criminal investigation of Catholic priests under the law, and attorneys' fees. Judge David G. Estudillo was assigned the case.\n\nThe United States intervened as a plaintiff, with the court reserving its ruling on the scope of relief it could seek. The United States also filed its own motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\nThe court granted plaintiffs' (not the United States') motion for a preliminary injunction. It found plaintiffs likely to succeed on their Free Exercise Clause claims, determining SB 5375 burdened their Catholic faith and uniquely modified existing law for clergy, unlike secular mandated reporters. The court further concluded the law failed strict scrutiny, noting Washington could adopt less restrictive approaches, as exemplified by 25 other states that make Catholic clergymen mandated reporters but exclude confession-derived information.\n\nThe court declined to address plaintiffs' Church Autonomy Doctrine and Establishment Clause claims. Consequently, defendants were enjoined from enforcing SB 5375 regarding the sacrament of confession across all three Washington Catholic dioceses. Injunctive relief was not sought or granted for faiths other than Catholicism.\n\nThe United States subsequently withdrew its preliminary injunction motion without prejudice. This withdrawal followed express assurances from defendants that, given the preliminary relief granted to plaintiffs, SB 5375 would not be enforced \"as [applied] to confession or sacred confidences shared with any clergy\" for the injunction's duration.

A priest who breaks the confidentiality of confession faces \"eternal damnation\" and automatic removal from the Catholic Church.\n\nWashington's three Catholic regions (dioceses) already required reporting of suspected child abuse, even more than state law demanded.

This was because the law made it harder for plaintiffs to practice their Catholic faith. Also, the law changed existing rules only for religious leaders, not for other non-religious people who are required to report.

              "transformed_text": "A Washington state law, Senate Bill 5375, which forced priests to report suspected child abuse or neglect they heard about during confession, was challenged in this case. Confession is a key religious practice, one of the seven sacraments of the Catholic Church, and has been central to its beliefs for 2,000 years. A priest who breaks the secrecy of confession faces severe religious penalties, including \"eternal damnation\" and automatic removal from the Catholic Church.\n\nThe three Catholic regions in Washington, called dioceses, already had rules for reporting suspected child abuse, in some ways stricter than state law. However, they made an exception for what priests learned only during confession. The plaintiffs argued that the new state law went against their rights under the First Amendment, which protects religious freedom, the Equal Protection Clause, which ensures fair treatment under the law, and the Washington State Constitution.\n\nEleven Catholic archbishops and priests, with legal help from Wilmer Hale and the Becket Fund for religious liberty, filed this lawsuit. They filed the case in a federal court, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, on May 29, 2025. They sued the Governor, Washington's Attorney General, and all county prosecutors in the state, naming them as the defendants. The plaintiffs asked the court to rule that the state law was unconstitutional, meaning it violated the Constitution. They also requested a temporary and then a lasting court order, called an injunction, to stop any criminal investigations of Catholic priests under this law. They also wanted their legal costs covered. Judge David G. Estudillo was put in charge of the case.\n\nThe U.S. government asked to join the lawsuit on June 23, 2025, as another plaintiff, or party bringing the suit. The court allowed the U.S. to join on July 15, 2025. But the court said it would decide later what specific actions or \"relief\" the U.S. government could seek. The U.S. then filed its own request for a temporary court order, or preliminary injunction, on June 25, 2025. This was separate from the earlier request made by the original plaintiffs.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the court approved the original plaintiffs' request for a temporary injunction, but not the U.S. government's. The court believed the plaintiffs would likely win their case, finding that SB 5375 probably violated the Free Exercise Clause, which protects a person's right to practice their religion freely. This was because the law made it harder for the plaintiffs to practice their Catholic faith. Also, the law changed rules only for religious leaders, while not doing the same for other non-religious people who are also required to report child abuse. The court also found that the law did not pass \"strict scrutiny,\" a very tough legal test used to see if a law significantly limits fundamental rights. Washington could have used a less strict approach, like 25 other states. These states require Catholic clergy to report child abuse, but they do not force them to report information heard only during confession.\n\nThe court did not decide on the plaintiffs' other arguments, such as those based on the Church Autonomy Doctrine, which gives religious groups freedom to govern themselves, or the Establishment Clause, which prevents the government from favoring one religion. Because of this, the defendants were ordered to stop enforcing SB 5375 when it came to the sacrament of confession in all three Catholic dioceses in Washington. (The plaintiffs did not ask for, and the court did not give, this order for religions other than Catholicism.)\n\nOn July 23, 2025, the U.S. government pulled back its request for a temporary injunction. It did this \"without prejudice,\" which means it could file the request again later if necessary. The U.S. government made this move because the defendants had promised that if the court granted the original plaintiffs a temporary order (which it did), they would not try to enforce SB 5375 regarding confession or other private, sacred talks shared with any religious leader while that temporary order was active.\n\nThis case is still ongoing.",

              "transformed_text": "Imagine a new school rule that forces students to tell the principal everything they hear in private conversations, even if it's about something serious. Well, a Washington state law, called Senate Bill 5375, was kind of like that, but for priests. It said priests had to report suspected child abuse or neglect they heard during confession. Confession is a really important religious practice for Catholics. It's one of their seven \"sacraments,\" which are sacred rituals, and it's been a core part of their faith for 2,000 years. If a priest breaks the secrecy of confession, they face very serious religious punishments, like being kicked out of the Catholic Church and facing what they believe is \"eternal damnation.\"\n\nEven before this new law, the three main Catholic areas in Washington (called \"dioceses\") already had their own rules for reporting suspected child abuse. In some ways, their rules were even tougher than the state's. But they made one big exception: priests didn't have to report things they heard *only* during confession. The people who sued (called \"plaintiffs\") argued that this new state law went against their rights. They said it violated the First Amendment, which protects religious freedom (like the right to practice your faith without the government interfering). They also said it violated the Equal Protection Clause, which means everyone should be treated fairly under the law, and the Washington State Constitution.\n\nEleven Catholic archbishops and priests, with help from lawyers at Wilmer Hale and a group called the Becket Fund for religious liberty, started this lawsuit. They took their case to a federal court, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, on May 29, 2025. They sued the Governor, Washington's Attorney General (the state's top lawyer), and all the county prosecutors in the state. These officials were called the \"defendants\" – the ones being sued. The plaintiffs asked the court to say that the state law was \"unconstitutional,\" which means it broke the rules of the U.S. Constitution. They also asked for a special court order, called an \"injunction,\" to temporarily and then permanently stop any criminal investigations of Catholic priests under this law. And they wanted the government to pay for their legal costs. Judge David G. Estudillo was assigned to oversee the case.\n\nThen, the U.S. government asked to join the lawsuit on June 23, 2025. They wanted to be another \"plaintiff,\" meaning another party supporting the lawsuit. The court allowed the U.S. government to join on July 15, 2025. But the court said it would decide later what specific help or \"relief\" the U.S. government could ask for. The U.S. government then filed its own request for a temporary court order, or \"preliminary injunction,\" on June 25, 2025. This was a separate request from the one the original plaintiffs had made.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the court said \"yes\" to the original plaintiffs' request for a temporary injunction, but \"no\" to the U.S. government's request. The court thought the plaintiffs would probably win their case. It found that SB 5375 likely violated the \"Free Exercise Clause\" of the First Amendment, which protects your right to practice your religion freely without the government interfering. This was because the law made it harder for the plaintiffs to practice their Catholic faith. Also, the law changed rules only for religious leaders, but not for other non-religious people who are also required to report child abuse. The court also found that the law did not pass \"strict scrutiny.\" This is a very tough legal test courts use to decide if a law that limits important rights is truly necessary. Washington could have used a less strict approach, like 25 other states do. These states require Catholic priests to report child abuse, but they don't force them to report information they heard *only* during confession.\n\nThe court didn't make a decision on the plaintiffs' other arguments. For example, they didn't rule on the \"Church Autonomy Doctrine,\" which says religious groups should have the freedom to run their own affairs, or the \"Establishment Clause,\" which stops the government from favoring one religion over others. Because of this, the defendants (the state officials) were ordered to stop enforcing SB 5375 when it came to the sacrament of confession in all three Catholic areas in Washington. (It's important to note that the plaintiffs only asked for this order for Catholicism, and the court didn't extend it to other religions.)\n\nOn July 23, 2025, the U.S. government decided to pull back its request for a temporary injunction. They did this \"without prejudice,\" which is a legal term meaning they could ask for it again later if they needed to. The U.S. government did this because the defendants had promised that if the court gave the original plaintiffs a temporary order (which it did), they wouldn't try to enforce SB 5375 when it came to confession or other private, sacred talks shared with *any* religious leader, as long as that temporary order was in place.\n\nThis case is still ongoing.",

              "transformed_text": "Washington state's SB 5375 created a profound dilemma for Catholic priests, demanding they report suspected child abuse or neglect disclosed during confession. This directly challenged a practice central to Catholic theology for two millennia, where breaking the seal of confession carries the severe penalty of \"eternal damnation\" and automatic excommunication. While Washington's Catholic dioceses already mandated reporting for most abuse cases, the law's unique targeting of information learned exclusively in confession forced priests into an irreconcilable conflict between their spiritual duties and legal obligations.\n\nFaced with this direct assault on religious freedom, eleven Catholic archbishops and priests, represented by Wilmer Hale and the Becket Fund, initiated a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. Their strategic purpose in filing this action was to defend the sanctity of confession and prevent the criminalization of their religious practices. They sought not only a declaration that the state law was unconstitutional but also an immediate preliminary injunction to halt its enforcement, recognizing the spiritual peril priests would face if forced to comply. The lawsuit named the Governor, Attorney General, and every County Prosecuting Attorney in Washington as defendants.\n\nRecognizing the significant constitutional implications for religious liberty, the United States chose to join the plaintiffs' cause. Its intervention was a strategic move to lend federal support to the challenge against SB 5375, reinforcing the argument that the law infringed upon fundamental rights and aiming to ensure the broadest possible protection against its enforcement. The court granted the United States permission to intervene.\n\nThe court, perceiving the urgency of the situation and the strong likelihood that the plaintiffs' religious freedom was being violated, swiftly granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. This critical decision served as an immediate, temporary halt to the enforcement of SB 5375 regarding the sacrament of confession. The court's ruling signaled its preliminary view that the law likely overstepped constitutional bounds by burdening the plaintiffs' exercise of their Catholic faith, particularly as it modified existing law solely for clergy and failed to meet the high standard of strict scrutiny. The court noted that Washington could have followed the less restrictive approach of many other states, which make clergy mandated reporters but exclude information learned solely from confession.\n\nFollowing the court's injunction, and upon receiving express assurances from the defendants that the state would not seek to enforce SB 5375 \"as [applied] to confession or sacred confidences shared with any clergy\" for the duration of preliminary relief, the United States withdrew its separate motion for a preliminary injunction. This move indicated that the immediate threat had been sufficiently mitigated, and the federal government's primary objective of protecting religious liberty had been, for the moment, achieved.

              "transformed_text": "The central legal question in this case concerned whether Washington state's SB 5375, which compelled Catholic priests to report suspected child abuse disclosed during confession, violated their religious freedom by demanding they break the sacred seal of confession. This law forced priests into an irreconcilable conflict between their spiritual duties, which carry the penalty of \"eternal damnation\" and excommunication for breaking the seal, and their new legal obligations.\n\nAfter eleven Catholic archbishops and priests, represented by Wilmer Hale and the Becket Fund, filed a lawsuit against the Governor, Attorney General, and every County Prosecuting Attorney in Washington to challenge the law, the United States chose to join their cause and was granted permission to intervene.\n\nThe court swiftly recognized the urgency and the strong likelihood that the law infringed upon the plaintiffs' religious freedom, granting a preliminary injunction to immediately halt the enforcement of SB 5375 as it applied to the sacrament of confession. The court's reasoning underscored that the law likely overstepped constitutional bounds by burdening the plaintiffs' exercise of their Catholic faith, particularly because it modified existing law solely for clergy and failed to meet the high standard of strict scrutiny. It noted that Washington could have adopted the less restrictive approach of many other states, which make clergy mandated reporters but specifically exclude information learned solely from confession. Following this critical decision, and upon receiving express assurances from the defendants that the state would not enforce the law regarding confession for the duration of preliminary relief, the United States withdrew its separate motion for a preliminary injunction, indicating the immediate threat had been sufficiently mitigated. The case remains ongoing.",

        "summary": "<p>This case is about the government&rsquo;s prepublication review (PPR) regime which exposed intelligence-agency employees and military personnel to possible sanction if they wrote or spoke about their government service without first obtaining the government&rsquo;s approval. On April 2, 2019, five former employees of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Department of Defense filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and Knight First Amendment Institute, sued the Director of National Intelligence, the Director of the CIA, the Secretary of Defense, and the Director of the NSA. The plaintiffs argued that the policy, which granted executive officers sweeping discretion to suppress publications and speech, violated their First and Fifth Amendment rights. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin defendants from continuing to enforce the prepublication review regimes against the plaintiffs or any other person. The case was assigned to Judge George Jarrod Hazel.</p>\r\n<p>In their complaint, plaintiffs recognized that the agencies had a legitimate government interest in protecting bona fide national security secrets but argued that prior restraint was an extreme measure justifiable only in circumstances involving a compelling government interest, where procedural safeguards against censorship would be necessary. They alleged that the PPR regime restrained more far more speech than could be justified by any legitimate government interest. They also argued that the policy should be void for vagueness under the First and Fifth Amendments because it failed to provide former government employees with fair notice of what they must submit for prepublication review and of what they can and cannot publish. This vagueness invited arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the prepublication review, especially for speech criticizing intelligence agencies and their practices.</p>\r\n<p>Discovery continued until April 16, 2020, when Judge Hazel granted the defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss. Judge Hazel rejected the defendants&rsquo; argument that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they had failed to identify any future concrete harm that they were likely to encounter because of the deficiencies they claimed exist in the PPR regimes. He agreed with the plaintiffs that the defendants&rsquo; PPR regimes had a chilling effect on protected speech, finding that the plaintiffs had demonstrated that they themselves had been deterred from exercising their First Amendment rights. But Judge Hazel did not agree with the plaintiffs&rsquo; theory that they were subject to government licensing schemes that invest executive officers with overly broad discretion, which by itself confers standing; he asserted that the PPR regime as described by the plaintiffs could not be understood as a licensing scheme. Judge Hazel then addressed the defendants&rsquo; argument that the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were unripe; the defendants asserted that the plaintiffs were challenging how the PPR regime might operate in the future rather than opposing any current prepublication review decision. However, Judge Hazel rejected the defendants&rsquo; argument because the ripeness standard is loosened in First Amendment cases, so the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were ripe for adjudication because they were being subjected to PPR regimes that they reasonably alleged required them to self-censor.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Hazel next turned to address the merits of the plaintiffs&rsquo; First Amendment claims. First, he rejected the plaintiffs&rsquo; argument that the PPR regime was unconstitutional prior restraint because the Supreme Court has already decided that a prepublication review requirement imposed on a government employee with access to classified information is not an unconstitutional prior restraint. Next, Judge Hazel agreed with the defendants that the PPR regimes were reasonable measures to protect the government&rsquo;s compelling interest in protecting sensitive information and thereby did not violate the plaintiffs&rsquo; First Amendment rights. Finally, he held that the regimes were not unduly vague under the First and Fifth Amendments because they adequately informed authors of the types of materials they must submit and established the kinds of information that could be redacted. Judge Hazel granted the motion to dismiss. 454 F.Supp.3d 502.</p>\r\n<p>In light of that ruling, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on May 12, 2020 (No. 20-1568). On June 23, 2021, a three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit, consisting of Judges Paul V. Niemeyer, Barbara Milano Keenan, and William B. Traxler, Jr., affirmed the district court&rsquo;s ruling granting the defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss. Their reasoning mirrored the district court; they agreed that although the plaintiffs did have standing and their claims were ripe, their claims were likely to fail on the merits. The circuit court particularly took issue with the fact that the plaintiffs were facially challenging the PPR regimes, that is as they applied generally rather than to the plaintiffs&rsquo; specific situations. They asserted that facial challenges like this are typically disfavored. The circuit court applied the test for facial challenges and determined, as the district court had, that the defendants&rsquo; PPR regimes were reasonable means of serving the government&rsquo;s compelling interest in keeping classified or otherwise sensitive information secret, and therefore did not violate the plaintiffs&rsquo; First Amendment rights. 2 F.4th 298.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court on November 29, 2021.

They sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The District Court addressed defendants' motion to dismiss, first ruling on standing and ripeness. Judge Hazel rejected defendants' arguments that plaintiffs lacked standing or that claims were unripe, agreeing that the PPR regimes had a chilling effect on protected speech and required self-censorship, thus conferring standing and ripeness. However, on the merits, the court rejected plaintiffs' argument that the PPR regime constituted unconstitutional prior restraint, citing Supreme Court precedent that such a requirement for employees with classified access is not unconstitutional. Judge Hazel agreed the PPR regimes were reasonable measures to protect the government’s compelling interest in safeguarding sensitive information and were not unduly vague, adequately informing authors of submission requirements and redaction criteria. Consequently, the defendants’ motion to dismiss was granted.\n\n*   **Fourth Circuit Affirmation:** Plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which affirmed the district court’s ruling. The Fourth Circuit panel mirrored the district court’s reasoning: while acknowledging plaintiffs had standing and their claims were ripe, they concluded the claims were likely to fail on the merits. The circuit court particularly scrutinized the plaintiffs’ facial challenge to the PPR regimes, noting that such challenges—applying generally rather than to specific situations—are typically disfavored. Applying the facial challenge test, the court determined, consistent with the district court, that the defendants’ PPR regimes constituted reasonable means of serving the government’s compelling interest in keeping classified or otherwise sensitive information secret, and therefore did not violate the plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights.\n\n*   **Supreme Court Petition:** The plaintiffs have filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court, which is currently pending, meaning the case remains ongoing.",

On April 2, 2019, five former employees of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Department of Defense filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and Knight First Amendment Institute, sued the Director of National Intelligence, the Director of the CIA, the Secretary of Defense, and the Director of the NSA. The plaintiffs argued that the policy, which granted executive officers sweeping discretion to suppress publications and speech, violated their First and Fifth Amendment rights. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin defendants from continuing to enforce the prepublication review regimes against the plaintiffs or any other person. The case was assigned to Judge George Jarrod Hazel.</p>\r\n<p>In their complaint, plaintiffs recognized that the agencies had a legitimate government interest in protecting bona fide national security secrets but argued that prior restraint was an extreme measure justifiable only in circumstances involving a compelling government interest, where procedural safeguards against censorship would be necessary. They alleged that the PPR regime restrained more far more speech than could be justified by any legitimate government interest. They also argued that the policy should be void for vagueness under the First and Fifth Amendments because it failed to provide former government employees with fair notice of what they must submit for prepublication review and of what they can and cannot publish. This vagueness invited arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the prepublication review, especially for speech criticizing intelligence agencies and their practices.</p>\r\n<p>Discovery continued until April 16, 2020, when Judge Hazel granted the defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss. Judge Hazel rejected the defendants&rsquo; argument that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they had failed to identify any future concrete harm that they were likely to encounter because of the deficiencies they claimed exist in the PPR regimes. He agreed with the plaintiffs that the defendants&rsquo; PPR regimes had a chilling effect on protected speech, finding that the plaintiffs had demonstrated that they themselves had been deterred from exercising their First Amendment rights. But Judge Hazel did not agree with the plaintiffs&rsquo; theory that they were subject to government licensing schemes that invest executive officers with overly broad discretion, which by itself confers standing; he asserted that the PPR regime as described by the plaintiffs could not be understood as a licensing scheme. Judge Hazel then addressed the defendants&rsquo; argument that the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were unripe; the defendants asserted that the plaintiffs were challenging how the PPR regime might operate in the future rather than opposing any current prepublication review decision. However, Judge Hazel rejected the defendants&rsquo; argument because the ripeness standard is loosened in First Amendment cases, so the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were ripe for adjudication because they were being subjected to PPR regimes that they reasonably alleged required them to self-censor.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Hazel next turned to address the merits of the plaintiffs&rsquo; First Amendment claims. First, he rejected the plaintiffs&rsquo; argument that the PPR regime was unconstitutional prior restraint because the Supreme Court has already decided that a prepublication review requirement imposed on a government employee with access to classified information is not an unconstitutional prior restraint. Next, Judge Hazel agreed with the defendants that the PPR regimes were reasonable measures to protect the government&rsquo;s compelling interest in protecting sensitive information and thereby did not violate the plaintiffs&rsquo; First Amendment rights. Finally, he held that the regimes were not unduly vague under the First and Fifth Amendments because they adequately informed authors of the types of materials they must submit and established the kinds of information that could be redacted. Judge Hazel granted the motion to dismiss. 454 F.Supp.3d 502.</p>\r\n<p>In light of that ruling, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on May 12, 2020 (No. 20-1568). On June 23, 2021, a three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit, consisting of Judges Paul V. Niemeyer, Barbara Milano Keenan, and William B. Traxler, Jr., affirmed the district court&rsquo;s ruling granting the defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss. Their reasoning mirrored the district court; they agreed that although the plaintiffs did have standing and their claims were ripe, their claims were likely to fail on the merits. The circuit court particularly took issue with the fact that the plaintiffs were facially challenging the PPR regimes, that is as they applied generally rather than to the plaintiffs&rsquo; specific situations. They asserted that facial challenges like this are typically disfavored. The circuit court applied the test for facial challenges and determined, as the district court had, that the defendants&rsquo; PPR regimes were reasonable means of serving the government&rsquo;s compelling interest in keeping classified or otherwise sensitive information secret, and therefore did not violate the plaintiffs&rsquo; First Amendment rights. 2 F.4th 298.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court on November 29, 2021. That petition is pending as of March 22, 2021, and the case is ongoing. &nbsp;</p>",

This system meant that employees of intelligence agencies and military personnel could face penalties if they wrote or spoke about their government work without getting government approval first. On April 2, 2019, five former employees from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Department of Defense sued in federal court in Maryland. The plaintiffs, represented by groups like the ACLU and Knight First Amendment Institute, sued top officials from national intelligence, the CIA, the Department of Defense, and the NSA. They claimed the policy gave government officials too much power to stop them from publishing or speaking, violating their First and Fifth Amendment rights. The plaintiffs asked the court to declare the policy illegal and to order the government to stop enforcing these prepublication review rules against them and others. Judge George Jarrod Hazel was assigned to the case.\n\nIn their lawsuit, the plaintiffs agreed that the government has a valid reason to protect real national security secrets. However, they argued that stopping speech before it happens (called \"prior restraint\") is an extreme step. They said it should only be allowed when the government has a very strong reason, and even then, there must be clear rules to prevent censorship. They claimed the PPR system blocked much more speech than any valid government interest could justify. They also argued the policy was too vague under the First and Fifth Amendments. This meant it didn't clearly tell former employees what they needed to submit for review or what they were allowed to publish. This lack of clarity, they said, could lead to unfair or biased enforcement of the review process, especially for speech that criticized intelligence agencies and their practices.\n\nThe information-gathering phase of the case continued until April 16, 2020. On that date, Judge Hazel agreed with the government's request to dismiss the case. Judge Hazel rejected the government's argument that the plaintiffs didn't have the right to sue (lacked \"standing\"). The government claimed the plaintiffs hadn't shown any specific future harm from the PPR system's flaws. But the judge agreed with the plaintiffs that the government's PPR rules discouraged protected speech. He found that the plaintiffs had shown they were afraid to use their First Amendment rights because of these rules. However, Judge Hazel disagreed with the plaintiffs' argument that the system was like a government licensing program that gave officials too much power, which alone would give them standing to sue. He stated that the PPR system, as the plaintiffs described it, wasn't a licensing program. Judge Hazel then looked at the government's argument that the plaintiffs' claims were \"unripe,\" meaning they weren't ready for a court decision. The government claimed the plaintiffs were challenging how the PPR system *might* work in the future, not a specific decision made now. But Judge Hazel rejected this, explaining that the rules for \"ripeness\" are less strict in First Amendment cases. He found the plaintiffs' claims were ready for court because they were already under PPR rules that, according to their reasonable claims, forced them to censor themselves.\n\nJudge Hazel then moved on to the actual legal arguments of the plaintiffs' First Amendment claims. First, he rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the PPR system was an unconstitutional \"prior restraint\" (stopping speech before it occurs). He pointed out that the Supreme Court had already ruled that requiring government employees with access to secret information to get prepublication review is not unconstitutional. Next, Judge Hazel agreed with the government that the PPR rules were reasonable ways to protect the government's strong interest in keeping sensitive information secret. Therefore, he found they did not violate the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights. Finally, he ruled that the rules were not too vague under the First and Fifth Amendments. He found they clearly enough told authors what materials to submit and what kind of information could be removed. So, Judge Hazel dismissed the case. 454 F.Supp.3d 502.\n\nAfter that decision, the plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on May 12, 2020 (No. 20-1568). On June 23, 2021, a panel of three judges from the Fourth Circuit, consisting of Judges Paul V. Niemeyer, Barbara Milano Keenan, and William B.

They agreed that while the plaintiffs had the right to sue (\"standing\") and their claims were ready for court (\"ripe\"), their arguments were likely to lose on the main legal points. The appeals court especially noted that the plaintiffs were challenging the PPR system \"on its face.\" This means they argued the rules were generally unconstitutional, not just how they applied to their specific situations. They stated that courts usually don't prefer these types of broad challenges. The appeals court applied the legal test for such challenges. Like the district court, it found that the government's PPR rules were reasonable ways to protect its strong interest in keeping secret or sensitive information confidential. Therefore, they did not violate the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights. 2 F.4th 298.\n\nThe plaintiffs asked the Supreme Court to hear their case by filing a petition on November 29, 2021.

Like the district court, it found that the government's PPR rules were reasonable ways to protect its strong interest in keeping secret or sensitive information confidential. Therefore, they did not violate the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights.\n\nThe plaintiffs asked the Supreme Court to hear their case by filing a petition on November 29, 2021. That request was still pending as of March 22, 2021, and the case is ongoing.",

              "transformed_text": "This case is about a government system called \"pre-publication review.\" Think of it like this: if you used to work for a spy agency or the military, this system meant you had to get official permission before you could write or speak about your government job. If you didn't, you could get into trouble.\n\nOn April 2, 2019, five former employees from different intelligence and defense agencies decided to sue the government in a federal court in Maryland. These former employees, with help from groups like the ACLU (which protects people's rights), sued the top officials from those agencies. They argued that these rules gave government officials too much power to stop them from sharing information. They said this broke their First Amendment right to speak freely and their Fifth Amendment right to fair treatment under the law. They asked the court to declare the rules illegal and to make the government stop enforcing them against them and other former employees. Judge George Jarrod Hazel was the judge assigned to this case.\n\nIn their lawsuit, the former employees agreed that the government has a good reason to protect real national security secrets. But they argued that stopping someone from speaking *before* they even say anything—which is called \"prior restraint\"—is a very serious step. They said it should only happen if the government has a super strong reason, and even then, there must be clear rules to make sure it's not just censorship. They claimed the system stopped way more speech than was necessary to protect government secrets. They also said the rules weren't clear enough under the First and Fifth Amendments. This is called \"void for vagueness,\" meaning the rules are so unclear they can't be fairly enforced. They argued the rules didn't clearly tell former employees what they had to get approved or what they were allowed to say. This lack of clarity, they argued, could lead to unfair treatment, especially if someone wanted to criticize the spy agencies.\n\nThe information gathering for the case went on until April 16, 2020. On that day, Judge Hazel decided to throw out the case, agreeing with the government. But first, Judge Hazel disagreed with the government's claim that the former employees didn't have the right to sue in the first place. This is called \"standing,\" like having a ticket to get into court. The government said the former employees hadn't shown they would be hurt by the rules in the future. But the judge agreed with the former employees that the rules made people afraid to speak, which is called a \"chilling effect,\" like a cold blanket that makes you not want to talk. He said the former employees had shown they were scared to use their right to free speech because of these rules. However, Judge Hazel didn't agree with the former employees' idea that the system was like a government giving out licenses, which would automatically give them the right to sue. He said the system wasn't like a licensing program.\n\nJudge Hazel then looked at another government argument: that the former employees' claims weren't \"ripe,\" meaning they weren't ready for a court decision yet, like fruit that's not ready to be picked. The government argued the former employees were complaining about how the system *might* work, not about something that had already happened. But Judge Hazel said no, because the rules for \"ripeness\" are a bit looser when it comes to free speech cases. He decided the claims were ready because the former employees were already living under rules that, they argued, made them censor themselves.\n\nThen, Judge Hazel looked at the actual reasons the former employees said their free speech rights were being violated. First, he disagreed with their claim that the system was an unconstitutional \"prior restraint\" (stopping speech before it happens). He said that the Supreme Court had already decided that making government employees with secrets get approval before publishing is okay. Next, Judge Hazel agreed with the government that the rules were fair ways to protect important secrets. So, he said they didn't break the former employees' free speech rights. Finally, he ruled that the rules were clear enough under the First and Fifth Amendments. He said they clearly told authors what to submit and what kind of information could be taken out. Because of all this, Judge Hazel threw out the case.\n\nAfter that, the former employees appealed the decision to a higher court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, on May 12, 2020. On June 23, 2021, three judges from that appeals court agreed with the first judge and kept the case dismissed. Their reasons were pretty much the same as the first judge's. They agreed that while the former employees had the right to sue (\"standing\") and their claims were ready for court (\"ripe\"), they also thought the former employees would likely lose the main arguments. The appeals court particularly pointed out that the former employees were challenging the system \"on its face.\" This means they were saying the rules were *always* unconstitutional, not just how they applied to them specifically. They said courts usually don't like these kinds of broad challenges. The appeals court used the special legal test for these types of challenges. And just like the first judge, they found that the government's rules were fair ways to protect important secret information. So, they said the rules didn't violate the former employees' free speech rights.\n\nThe former employees then asked the highest court in the country, the Supreme Court, to hear their case on November 29, 2021. As of March 22, 2021, that request was still waiting for a decision, which means the case is still ongoing.",

This rule meant you needed permission. You needed it before you could write or talk about your old job. If you didn't, you could get in trouble.\n\nOn April 2, 2019, five people sued the government. They used to work for spy groups or the military. They sued in a court in Maryland. Groups like the ACLU helped them. The ACLU helps protect people's rights. The former workers sued the leaders of those spy groups. They said the rules gave leaders too much power. They said it stopped them from sharing information. They felt this broke their rights. These rights let them speak freely. They also give them fair treatment under the law. They asked the court to say the rules were wrong. They wanted the government to stop using them. Judge George Jarrod Hazel was the judge.\n\nThe former workers agreed the government needs to keep secrets safe. But they said stopping someone from speaking before they even say anything is very serious. This is called \"prior restraint.\" They said it should only happen for a very strong reason. And there must be clear rules. This would stop it from being just censorship. They said the rules stopped too much talking. It stopped more than needed to protect secrets. They also said the rules were not clear enough. This is like a rule being \"void for vagueness.\" It means the rule is so unclear it can't be used fairly. They said the rules didn't tell them what they had to get approved. It didn't say what they could talk about. They worried this could lead to unfair treatment. Especially if they wanted to say bad things about the spy groups.\n\nThe case gathered information until April 16, 2020. Then, Judge Hazel made a decision. He threw out the case. He agreed with the government. But first, he disagreed with one thing the government said. The government said the former workers didn't have the right to sue. This is called \"standing.\" It's like needing a ticket to get into court. The government said the workers couldn't show they would be hurt later. But the judge agreed with the workers. He said the rules made people afraid to speak. This is called a \"chilling effect.\" It's like a cold blanket that makes you quiet. He said the workers were scared to use their right to speak freely. But the judge did not agree with another idea. The workers said the system was like getting a license from the government. The judge said it was not like that.\n\nJudge Hazel then looked at another government point. The government said the workers' complaints were not \"ripe.\" This means they were not ready for a court decision. Like fruit not ready to pick. The government said the workers were guessing about how the rules *might* work. Not about something that already happened. But Judge Hazel said no. He said the rules for \"ripeness\" are not as strict for free speech cases. He decided the complaints were ready. This was because the workers were already living under the rules. They said the rules made them stop themselves from speaking.\n\nNext, Judge Hazel looked at why the workers said their free speech rights were broken. First, he did not agree that the system was \"prior restraint.\" This is stopping speech before it happens. He said the highest court, the Supreme Court, already said it was okay. They said it was okay to make workers with secrets get approval. Next, Judge Hazel agreed with the government. He said the rules were fair ways to protect important secrets. So, he said they did not break the workers' free speech rights. Last, he said the rules were clear enough. They told writers what to send in. They also said what information could be removed. Because of all this, Judge Hazel threw out the case.\n\nAfter that, the former workers asked a higher court to look at the decision. This was the U.S. Court of Appeals. This happened on May 12, 2020.

The court said judges usually don't like these big challenges. The appeals court used a special test for these challenges. And like the first judge, they found the rules were fair. They protected important secret information. So, they said the rules did not break the workers' free speech rights.\n\nThe former workers then asked the highest court in the country to hear their case. This is the Supreme Court. They asked on November 29, 2021. As of March 22, 2021, the Supreme Court was still deciding. This means the case is still going on.",

On April 2, 2019, five former employees of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Department of Defense filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and Knight First Amendment Institute, sued the Director of National Intelligence, the Director of the CIA, the Secretary of Defense, and the Director of the NSA. The plaintiffs argued that the policy, which granted executive officers sweeping discretion to suppress publications and speech, violated their First and Fifth Amendment rights. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin defendants from continuing to enforce the prepublication review regimes against the plaintiffs or any other person. The case was assigned to Judge George Jarrod Hazel.</p>\r\n<p>In their complaint, plaintiffs recognized that the agencies had a legitimate government interest in protecting bona fide national security secrets but argued that prior restraint was an extreme measure justifiable only in circumstances involving a compelling government interest, where procedural safeguards against censorship would be necessary. They alleged that the PPR regime restrained more far more speech than could be justified by any legitimate government interest. They also argued that the policy should be void for vagueness under the First and Fifth Amendments because it failed to provide former government employees with fair notice of what they must submit for prepublication review and of what they can and cannot publish. This vagueness invited arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the prepublication review, especially for speech criticizing intelligence agencies and their practices.</p>\r\n<p>Discovery continued until April 16, 2020, when Judge Hazel granted the defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss. Judge Hazel rejected the defendants&rsquo; argument that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they had failed to identify any future concrete harm that they were likely to encounter because of the deficiencies they claimed exist in the PPR regimes. He agreed with the plaintiffs that the defendants&rsquo; PPR regimes had a chilling effect on protected speech, finding that the plaintiffs had demonstrated that they themselves had been deterred from exercising their First Amendment rights. But Judge Hazel did not agree with the plaintiffs&rsquo; theory that they were subject to government licensing schemes that invest executive officers with overly broad discretion, which by itself confers standing; he asserted that the PPR regime as described by the plaintiffs could not be understood as a licensing scheme. Judge Hazel then addressed the defendants&rsquo; argument that the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were unripe; the defendants asserted that the plaintiffs were challenging how the PPR regime might operate in the future rather than opposing any current prepublication review decision. However, Judge Hazel rejected the defendants&rsquo; argument because the ripeness standard is loosened in First Amendment cases, so the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were ripe for adjudication because they were being subjected to PPR regimes that they reasonably alleged required them to self-censor.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Hazel next turned to address the merits of the plaintiffs&rsquo; First Amendment claims. First, he rejected the plaintiffs&rsquo; argument that the PPR regime was unconstitutional prior restraint because the Supreme Court has already decided that a prepublication review requirement imposed on a government employee with access to classified information is not an unconstitutional prior restraint. Next, Judge Hazel agreed with the defendants that the PPR regimes were reasonable measures to protect the government&rsquo;s compelling interest in protecting sensitive information and thereby did not violate the plaintiffs&rsquo; First Amendment rights. Finally, he held that the regimes were not unduly vague under the First and Fifth Amendments because they adequately informed authors of the types of materials they must submit and established the kinds of information that could be redacted. Judge Hazel granted the motion to dismiss. 454 F.Supp.3d 502.</p>\r\n<p>In light of that ruling, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on May 12, 2020 (No. 20-1568). On June 23, 2021, a three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit, consisting of Judges Paul V. Niemeyer, Barbara Milano Keenan, and William B. Traxler, Jr., affirmed the district court&rsquo;s ruling granting the defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss. Their reasoning mirrored the district court; they agreed that although the plaintiffs did have standing and their claims were ripe, their claims were likely to fail on the merits. The circuit court particularly took issue with the fact that the plaintiffs were facially challenging the PPR regimes, that is as they applied generally rather than to the plaintiffs&rsquo; specific situations. They asserted that facial challenges like this are typically disfavored. The circuit court applied the test for facial challenges and determined, as the district court had, that the defendants&rsquo; PPR regimes were reasonable means of serving the government&rsquo;s compelling interest in keeping classified or otherwise sensitive information secret, and therefore did not violate the plaintiffs&rsquo; First Amendment rights. 2 F.4th 298.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court on November 29, 2021. That petition is pending as of March 22, 2021, and the case is ongoing. &nbsp;</p>",

On April 2, 2019, five former employees of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Department of Defense, represented by the ACLU and Knight First Amendment Institute, initiated this legal challenge in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. They brought suit against the Director of National Intelligence, the Director of the CIA, the Secretary of Defense, and the Director of the NSA, contending that the PPR policy, by granting executive officers broad power to suppress speech, violated their First and Fifth Amendment rights. Their aim was to secure a declaration that the policy was unlawful and an injunction to prevent its continued enforcement against them and others. The case was assigned to Judge George Jarrod Hazel.\n\nIn their complaint, the plaintiffs acknowledged the government's legitimate need to protect genuine national security secrets. However, they argued that prior restraint – the suppression of speech before it occurs – was an extreme measure, justifiable only in compelling circumstances and requiring robust procedural safeguards against censorship. They believed the PPR regime cast a net far wider than necessary, stifling more speech than any legitimate government interest could justify. Furthermore, they asserted the policy was unconstitutionally vague, failing to clearly inform former employees what they were required to submit for review or what they could and could not publish. This ambiguity, they argued, invited arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, particularly against speech critical of intelligence agencies.\n\nAs the case proceeded through discovery, the defendants sought to end the litigation early, filing a motion to dismiss. Their strategic purpose was to argue that the plaintiffs had no legal right to bring their claims or that the claims themselves were not yet ripe for judicial review. On April 16, 2020, Judge Hazel granted this motion. While he rejected the defendants' argument that the plaintiffs lacked standing, finding that the PPR regimes indeed had a chilling effect that deterred the plaintiffs from exercising their First Amendment rights, he disagreed with the plaintiffs' characterization of the regime as an overly broad government licensing scheme. Judge Hazel also dismissed the defendants' contention that the claims were unripe, recognizing that in First Amendment cases, the standard for ripeness is more lenient, and the plaintiffs' self-censorship under the PPR regimes made their claims ready for adjudication.\n\nDespite these initial victories for the plaintiffs on procedural grounds, Judge Hazel ultimately sided with the government on the core constitutional questions. He concluded that the PPR regime was not an unconstitutional prior restraint, citing Supreme Court precedent that allows such review for government employees with access to classified information. He also agreed with the defendants that these regimes were reasonable and necessary measures to protect the government's compelling interest in safeguarding sensitive information, thus not violating the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights. Finally, he found the regimes were not unduly vague, determining they adequately guided authors on what to submit and what information could be redacted. This reasoning led Judge Hazel to grant the defendants' motion to dismiss the case.\n\nDissatisfied with this outcome, the plaintiffs chose to appeal to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on May 12, 2020. Their strategic aim was to convince a higher court that the district court had erred in its interpretation of their constitutional rights. However, on June 23, 2021, a three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision. Their reasoning largely mirrored Judge Hazel's: while acknowledging the plaintiffs had standing and their claims were ripe, the court found their claims likely to fail on the merits. The circuit court particularly emphasized that the plaintiffs were challenging the PPR regimes \"facially\"—that is, as they applied generally, rather than to specific instances of censorship—a type of challenge typically disfavored by courts. Applying the test for facial challenges, the circuit court concluded, as the district court had, that the government's PPR regimes were reasonable means to protect its compelling interest in keeping classified or sensitive information secret, and therefore did not violate the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights.\n\nUndeterred, the plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court on November 29, 2021, seeking the nation's highest court to review their case and potentially overturn the lower court rulings. That petition remains pending as of March 22, 2021, signifying the ongoing nature of this legal battle over free speech and national security.",

Five former employees, represented by the ACLU and Knight First Amendment Institute, challenged this system, arguing it violated their First and Fifth Amendment rights by granting executive officers broad power to suppress speech. They sought to have the policy declared unlawful and its enforcement stopped.\n\nAfter the initial complaint, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, seeking to end the litigation. Though the district court ultimately sided with the government, Judge Hazel first addressed the government's procedural challenges, finding that the plaintiffs *did* have standing because the PPR system had a chilling effect on their speech, deterring them from exercising their First Amendment rights.

He concluded that the PPR regime was not an unconstitutional prior restraint, citing Supreme Court precedent that allows such review for government employees with access to classified information. He also agreed with the government that these regimes were reasonable and necessary measures to protect a compelling national security interest in safeguarding sensitive information, thus not violating the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights. Finally, he found the regimes were not unduly vague, determining they adequately guided authors on what to submit and what information could be redacted. This reasoning led to the dismissal of the case.\n\nThe plaintiffs appealed this decision, but the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling.

Applying the standard for facial challenges, the Fourth Circuit concluded that the government's PPR regimes were reasonable means to protect its compelling interest in keeping classified or otherwise sensitive information secret, and therefore did not violate the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights.\n\nUndeterred, the plaintiffs sought review from the Supreme Court, where their petition remains pending, highlighting the ongoing legal debate over free speech and national security.",

        "summary": "<p>On July 1, 2014, the Catholic Benefits Association and the Catholic Insurance Company filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma. The Catholic Benefits Association is an association of Catholic nonprofits and closely held for-profit employers that provide health benefits to their employees, and the Catholic Insurance Company, Inc. sells stop-loss insurance to some of these employers who self-fund their insurance plans. The plaintiffs alleged that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and related agencies' enforcement of the Affordable Care Act's (ACA's) contraceptive services mandate ('mandate') violated the plaintiffs' rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and violated the Administrative Procedures Act. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that notifying HHS of their religious objection to contraception started a chain of events that ended with their employees receiving contraceptive services. The plaintiffs claimed this violates their rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the Free Exercise, Establishment, and Free Speech clauses of the First Amendment, and the Administrative Procedures Act.</p>\r\n<p>The same plaintiffs had filed an earlier suit, The Catholic Benefits Ass'n v. Sebelius, No. 5:14-cv-00240-R (W.D. Okla. June 4, 2014), which had resulted in an injunction for their nonprofit and closely held for-profit member employers at the time. They filed an additional motion to add employers who joined the association following that date, but it was denied. The current suit is to add those members to the injunction. The court in the preceding case also ruled that the Catholic Insurance Company did not have standing to sue in its own right.</p>\r\n<p>On December 29, 2014, the court granted the Catholic Benefits Association a preliminary injunction against federal enforcement of the mandate for their current members who were nonprofit religious employers and for current members who were non-exempt closely held for-profit employers. 81 F.Supp.3d. 1269 (W.D. Oka. 2014). The court did not provide preliminary injunctive relief for future members of the association, for employers that met the ACA definition of religious employer and are exempt from mandate, or for the Catholic Insurance Company.</p>\r\n<p>In early 2015, both parties cross appealed the court's decision to grant in part and deny in part the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. On March 17, 2015, however, the Tenth Circuit granted the government's unopposed motion to hold this case and related appeals in abeyance pending resolution of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13143\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Little Sisters of the Poor v.

Burwell</a>.</p>\r\n<p>On October 23, 2017, the Tenth Circuit dismissed both appeals pursuant to the plaintiffs' motion for voluntary dismissal. The plaintiffs then filed a motion for a permanent injunction and declaratory judgment on November 1, 2017. They argued that although there was a circuit split over whether the accommodation under the mandate substantially burdened religious exercise, the government changed its position once the issue was before the Supreme Court in 2016.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13465\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Zubik v. Burwell.</a>&nbsp;In Interim Final Rules issued in October 2017, the government admitted that the accommodation did substantially burden religious exercise and was illegal under RFRA.</p>\r\n<p>On March 7, 2018, the Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for a permanent injunction. The Court permanently enjoined the government from enforcing the mandate against CBA members, their health plans, their health insurance issuers, or third-party administrators in connection with their health plans, to the extent that it required CBA members to contract, arrange, pay, or refer for religiously-objectionable medical care. The Court also declared that the mandate violated RFRA. In August, 2018, the Court awarded the plaintiffs $699,725.95 in attorneys' fees and $18,881.41 in expenses not recoverable under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1920. The case is now closed.</p>",

Plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sought declaratory and injunctive relief. They alleged that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and related agencies' enforcement of the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) contraceptive services mandate violated their rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). Plaintiffs further claimed that notifying HHS of their religious objection to contraception initiated a chain of events that ultimately resulted in their employees receiving contraceptive services, which they asserted violated their rights under RFRA, the Free Exercise, Establishment, and Free Speech clauses of the First Amendment, and the APA.\n\nPlaintiffs had previously filed *The Catholic Benefits Ass'n v. Sebelius*, which resulted in an injunction for their then-current nonprofit and closely held for-profit member employers. A subsequent motion to add employers who joined the association after that date was denied. The instant action sought to extend injunctive relief to these later-joining members. The court in the prior case also determined that the Catholic Insurance Company lacked standing to sue independently.\n\nOn December 29, 2014, the court granted CBA a preliminary injunction, enjoining federal enforcement of the mandate against its current nonprofit religious employers and non-exempt closely held for-profit employers. However, preliminary injunctive relief was denied for future association members, employers meeting the ACA's religious employer exemption, and the Catholic Insurance Company.\n\nBoth parties cross-appealed the court's partial grant and denial of the preliminary injunction. The Tenth Circuit subsequently granted the government's unopposed motion to hold this case and related appeals in abeyance, pending resolution of *Little Sisters of the Poor v. Burwell*, *Southern Nazarene University v. Burwell*, and *Reaching Souls International v. Burwell*.\n\nOn October 23, 2017, the Tenth Circuit dismissed both appeals following the plaintiffs' motion for voluntary dismissal. Plaintiffs then moved for a permanent injunction and declaratory judgment on November 1, 2017. They contended that despite a prior circuit split regarding whether the mandate's accommodation substantially burdened religious exercise, the government's stance shifted after *Zubik v. Burwell* was before the Supreme Court in 2016. Specifically, in Interim Final Rules issued in October 2017, the government conceded that the accommodation did substantially burden religious exercise and was unlawful under RFRA.\n\nOn March 7, 2018, the Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for a permanent injunction. This injunction prohibited enforcement against CBA members, their health plans, their health insurance issuers, or their third-party administrators to the extent it compelled CBA members to contract, arrange, pay, or refer for religiously objectionable medical care. The Court also declared the mandate violated RFRA. In August 2018, the Court awarded plaintiffs $699,725.95 in attorneys' fees and $18,881.41 in non-recoverable expenses. The case is now closed.",

Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and related agencies' enforcement of the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) contraceptive services mandate violated their rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). Plaintiffs further contended that the HHS notification process, leading to employees receiving contraceptive services, violated their rights under RFRA, the Free Exercise, Establishment, and Free Speech clauses of the First Amendment, and the APA.\n\nThis action aimed to extend injunctive relief to members who joined the CBA after a prior suit, *The Catholic Benefits Ass'n v. Sebelius*, which had secured an injunction for then-current nonprofit and closely held for-profit member employers. In that prior case, a motion to add later-joining employers was denied, and the Catholic Insurance Company was found to lack standing to sue independently.\n\nOn December 29, 2014, the court granted CBA a preliminary injunction, enjoining federal enforcement of the mandate against its current nonprofit religious employers and non-exempt closely held for-profit employers. However, preliminary injunctive relief was denied for future association members, employers meeting the ACA's religious employer exemption, and the Catholic Insurance Company.\n\nBoth parties cross-appealed the preliminary injunction ruling. The Tenth Circuit subsequently held the appeals in abeyance, pending resolution of *Little Sisters of the Poor v. Burwell*, *Southern Nazarene University v. Burwell*, and *Reaching Souls International v. Burwell*. On October 23, 2017, the Tenth Circuit dismissed both appeals upon the plaintiffs' motion for voluntary dismissal.\n\nPlaintiffs then moved for permanent injunctive and declaratory relief on November 1, 2017. They argued that despite a prior circuit split regarding whether the mandate's accommodation substantially burdened religious exercise, the government's stance shifted after *Zubik v. Burwell* was before the Supreme Court in 2016. Specifically, Interim Final Rules issued in October 2017 conceded that the accommodation did substantially burden religious exercise and was unlawful under RFRA.\n\nOn March 7, 2018, the Court granted plaintiffs' motion for a permanent injunction. This injunction prohibited enforcement against CBA members, their health plans, their health insurance issuers, or their third-party administrators to the extent it compelled CBA members to contract, arrange, pay, or refer for religiously objectionable medical care. The Court also declared the mandate violated RFRA. In August 2018, the Court awarded plaintiffs $699,725.95 in attorneys' fees and $18,881.41 in non-recoverable expenses. The case is now closed.",

The Catholic Benefits Association is an association of Catholic nonprofits and closely held for-profit employers that provide health benefits to their employees, and the Catholic Insurance Company, Inc. sells stop-loss insurance to some of these employers who self-fund their insurance plans. The plaintiffs alleged that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and related agencies' enforcement of the Affordable Care Act's (ACA's) contraceptive services mandate ('mandate') violated the plaintiffs' rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and violated the Administrative Procedures Act. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that notifying HHS of their religious objection to contraception started a chain of events that ended with their employees receiving contraceptive services. The plaintiffs claimed this violates their rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the Free Exercise, Establishment, and Free Speech clauses of the First Amendment, and the Administrative Procedures Act.</p>\r\n<p>The same plaintiffs had filed an earlier suit, The Catholic Benefits Ass'n v.

They filed an additional motion to add employers who joined the association following that date, but it was denied. The current suit is to add those members to the injunction.

The Catholic Benefits Association is a group of Catholic nonprofits and privately-owned for-profit businesses that provide health benefits to their employees. The Catholic Insurance Company, Inc. sells insurance that covers large claims for some of these employers who pay for their own health plans. The plaintiffs claimed that how the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and related agencies enforced the Affordable Care Act's (ACA's) rule requiring coverage for contraceptive services (the 'mandate') went against their rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). With their own lawyers, the plaintiffs asked the court for a declaration that their rights were violated and an order to stop the government from enforcing the mandate. They argued that telling HHS about their religious objection to contraception still led to their employees getting these services. The plaintiffs claimed this violated their rights under RFRA, the First Amendment's clauses on Free Exercise, Establishment, and Free Speech, and the APA.\n\nThe same plaintiffs had filed an earlier lawsuit, *The Catholic Benefits Ass'n v. Sebelius*, which had resulted in a court order (an injunction) protecting their nonprofit and privately-owned for-profit member employers at that time. They later asked to add employers who joined the association after that date, but the court denied this request. This current lawsuit aimed to include those new members in the existing injunction. In the earlier case, the court also decided that the Catholic Insurance Company could not sue on its own.\n\nOn December 29, 2014, the court issued a temporary order (a preliminary injunction) favoring the Catholic Benefits Association. This order stopped the government from enforcing the mandate against their current members who were religious nonprofits and current members who were privately-owned for-profit businesses not exempt from the rule. However, the court did not extend this temporary protection to future members of the association, to employers already exempt from the mandate under the ACA's religious employer definition, or to the Catholic Insurance Company.\n\nIn early 2015, both sides appealed parts of the court's decision regarding the preliminary injunction. However, on March 17, 2015, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to the government's request to pause this case and other related appeals. This pause was until other similar cases, like *Little Sisters of the Poor v. Burwell*, were decided.\n\nOn October 23, 2017, the Tenth Circuit dismissed both appeals after the plaintiffs asked to voluntarily withdraw them. The plaintiffs then filed a new request on November 1, 2017, asking for a permanent injunction and a declaration from the court. They argued that even though different courts had disagreed on whether the mandate's 'accommodation' (a workaround for religious objectors) significantly burdened religious practice, the government itself changed its stance. This change happened after the issue went before the Supreme Court in 2016 in the *Zubik v. Burwell* case. In new rules issued in October 2017, the government acknowledged that the accommodation did indeed place a significant burden on religious exercise and was not legal under RFRA.\n\nOn March 7, 2018, the Court granted the plaintiffs' request for a permanent injunction. The Court permanently stopped the government from enforcing the mandate against CBA members, their health plans, their insurance providers, or third-party administrators. This injunction applied specifically to the extent the mandate required CBA members to arrange, pay for, or refer for medical care that went against their religious beliefs. The Court also stated that the mandate itself violated RFRA. In August 2018, the Court ordered the government to pay the plaintiffs $699,725.95 for their lawyers' fees and $18,881.41 for other expenses not covered by standard rules. The case is now closed.",

              "transformed_text": "On July 1, 2014, the Catholic Benefits Association and the Catholic Insurance Company filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma. The Catholic Benefits Association is a group of Catholic non-profit organizations and private businesses that offer health benefits to their employees. The Catholic Insurance Company, Inc. sells insurance that helps these employers cover very large health claims for their self-funded plans. The groups claimed that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and related agencies were enforcing a rule under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that required health plans to cover birth control services. They argued this rule, often called the 'mandate,' violated their rights under a law known as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and another law called the Administrative Procedures Act. Through their lawyers, the groups asked the court to officially state that their rights were being violated and to order the government to stop enforcing the birth control mandate. They argued that even if they told HHS about their religious objection to birth control, their employees would still end up receiving these services. The groups said this violated their rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, as well as their First Amendment rights to freedom of religion and speech, and the Administrative Procedures Act.\n\nThese same groups had filed an earlier lawsuit, which had led to a court order, called an injunction, that protected their non-profit and private business members at the time. They later tried to add employers who joined the association after that court order, but the court said no. This new lawsuit aimed to get those newer members included in the existing protection. In the earlier case, the court also ruled that the Catholic Insurance Company did not have the legal right to sue on its own.\n\nOn December 29, 2014, the court issued a temporary order, called a preliminary injunction, in favor of the Catholic Benefits Association. This order temporarily stopped the government from enforcing the birth control mandate against their current members who were religious non-profits and current members who were private businesses not already exempt from the rule. However, the court did not extend this temporary protection to future members of the association, to employers already exempt from the mandate under the ACA's religious employer definition, or to the Catholic Insurance Company.\n\nIn early 2015, both sides appealed parts of the court's decision about the temporary order. However, on March 17, 2015, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to the government's request to put this case and other similar appeals on hold. This pause was until other similar cases, like *Little Sisters of the Poor v. Burwell*, were decided.\n\nOn October 23, 2017, the Tenth Circuit dismissed both appeals after the groups asked to drop them. The groups then filed a new request on November 1, 2017, asking for a permanent order to stop the government and an official declaration from the court. They argued that even though different courts had disagreed on whether the birth control rule's 'accommodation' – which was a way for religious objectors to avoid directly providing the coverage – truly burdened their religious practice, the government itself changed its mind. This change happened after the issue went before the Supreme Court in 2016 in the *Zubik v. Burwell* case. In new rules issued in October 2017, the government admitted that the accommodation did indeed place a significant burden on religious freedom and was not legal under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nOn March 7, 2018, the Court granted the groups' request for a permanent order to stop the government. The Court permanently stopped the government from enforcing the birth control mandate against members of the Catholic Benefits Association, their health plans, their insurance providers, or other companies that manage their health plans. This order specifically applied if the mandate required CBA members to arrange, pay for, or refer for medical care that went against their religious beliefs. The Court also stated that the birth control mandate itself violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. In August 2018, the Court ordered the government to pay the groups $699,725.95 for their lawyers' fees and $18,881.41 for other expenses not typically covered. The case is now closed.",

              "transformed_text": "Imagine a group called the Catholic Benefits Association and another called the Catholic Insurance Company. On July 1, 2014, they went to a federal court in Oklahoma to file a lawsuit. The Catholic Benefits Association is like a club for Catholic non-profit groups and private businesses that provide health insurance to their workers. The Catholic Insurance Company sells a special kind of insurance to help these employers pay for really big medical bills, especially if they manage their own health plans.\n\nThese groups argued that a government agency, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), was making them follow a rule under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) – a big healthcare law – that said their health plans had to pay for birth control. They said this rule, often called the 'mandate,' went against their religious freedom, protected by a law called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. They also claimed it violated rules about how government agencies should operate, found in the Administrative Procedures Act. Their lawyers asked the court to declare that their rights were being violated and to order the government to stop making them follow the birth control rule. They argued that even if they told HHS they had religious objections to birth control, their employees would still get these services, which they felt forced them to be involved. They believed this violated their religious freedom and free speech rights under the First Amendment of the Constitution, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and the Administrative Procedures Act.\n\nNow, this wasn't their first time in court. These same groups had sued before, and that earlier lawsuit resulted in a special court order, called an 'injunction,' which was like a shield protecting their non-profit and private business members from the rule back then. Later, they tried to get other employers who joined their association *after* that first court order included in the protection, but the court didn't allow it. So, this *new* lawsuit was specifically to get those newer members covered by the same protection. Also, in that first case, the court decided that the Catholic Insurance Company couldn't sue by itself; it didn't have the 'standing' or legal right to do so.\n\nOn December 29, 2014, the court gave the Catholic Benefits Association a temporary win. It issued a 'preliminary injunction,' which is a temporary order stopping something from happening. This order temporarily stopped the government from making their current members – both the religious non-profits and the private businesses not already excused from the rule – follow the birth control mandate. But the court *didn't* extend this temporary protection to members who joined later, to employers who were already excused from the rule under the ACA's definition of a religious employer, or to the Catholic Insurance Company.\n\nIn early 2015, both the Catholic Benefits Association and the government disagreed with parts of the court's temporary order, so they asked a higher court, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, to review it. However, on March 17, 2015, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the government to put this case, and others like it, on pause. This pause was like hitting the 'stop' button until other very similar cases, such as *Little Sisters of the Poor v. Burwell*, were decided by the courts.\n\nOn October 23, 2017, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals officially closed both appeals because the groups asked to drop them. Then, on November 1, 2017, the groups filed a new request, asking the court for a permanent order to stop the government and an official statement that their rights were violated. They argued that even though different courts had disagreed about whether the birth control rule's 'accommodation' – which was a way for religious groups to avoid directly paying for or providing the coverage – truly created a problem for their religious beliefs, the government itself later changed its mind. This change happened after the highest court in the land, the Supreme Court, looked at the issue in 2016 in a case called *Zubik v. Burwell*. In new rules released in October 2017, the government actually admitted that this 'accommodation' *did* put a real burden on religious freedom and wasn't allowed under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nOn March 7, 2018, the Court agreed with the groups and issued a permanent order to stop the government. This order permanently stopped the government from making members of the Catholic Benefits Association, their health plans, their insurance companies, or other companies managing their health plans follow the birth control rule. This was especially true if the rule made CBA members arrange, pay for, or recommend medical care that went against their religious beliefs. The Court also officially stated that the birth control rule itself violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. In August 2018, the Court ordered the government to pay the groups nearly $700,000 for their lawyers' fees and over $18,000 for other related costs. The case is now officially closed.",

              "text": "<p>On July 1, 2014, the Catholic Benefits Association and the Catholic Insurance Company filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma. The Catholic Benefits Association is an association of Catholic nonprofits and closely held for-profit employers that provide health benefits to their employees, and the Catholic Insurance Company, Inc. sells stop-loss insurance to some of these employers who self-fund their insurance plans. The plaintiffs alleged that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and related agencies' enforcement of the Affordable Care Act's (ACA's) contraceptive services mandate ('mandate') violated the plaintiffs' rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and violated the Administrative Procedures Act. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that notifying HHS of their religious objection to contraception started a chain of events that ended with their employees receiving contraceptive services. The plaintiffs claimed this violates their rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the Free Exercise, Establishment, and Free Speech clauses of the First Amendment, and the Administrative Procedures Act.</p>\r\n<p>The same plaintiffs had filed an earlier suit, The Catholic Benefits Ass'n v. Sebelius, No. 5:14-cv-00240-R (W.D. Okla. June 4, 2014), which had resulted in an injunction for their nonprofit and closely held for-profit member employers at the time. They filed an additional motion to add employers who joined the association following that date, but it was denied. The current suit is to add those members to the injunction. The court in the preceding case also ruled that the Catholic Insurance Company did not have standing to sue in its own right.</p>\r\n<p>On December 29, 2014, the court granted the Catholic Benefits Association a preliminary injunction against federal enforcement of the mandate for their current members who were nonprofit religious employers and for current members who were non-exempt closely held for-profit employers. 81 F.Supp.3d. 1269 (W.D. Oka. 2014). The court did not provide preliminary injunctive relief for future members of the association, for employers that met the ACA definition of religious employer and are exempt from mandate, or for the Catholic Insurance Company.</p>\r\n<p>In early 2015, both parties cross appealed the court's decision to grant in part and deny in part the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. On March 17, 2015, however, the Tenth Circuit granted the government's unopposed motion to hold this case and related appeals in abeyance pending resolution of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13143\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Little Sisters of the Poor v. Burwell</a>, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13267\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Southern Nazarene University v. Burwell</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13059\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reaching Souls International v. Burwell</a>.</p>\r\n<p>On October 23, 2017, the Tenth Circuit dismissed both appeals pursuant to the plaintiffs' motion for voluntary dismissal. The plaintiffs then filed a motion for a permanent injunction and declaratory judgment on November 1, 2017. They argued that although there was a circuit split over whether the accommodation under the mandate substantially burdened religious exercise, the government changed its position once the issue was before the Supreme Court in 2016.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13465\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Zubik v. Burwell.</a>&nbsp;In Interim Final Rules issued in October 2017, the government admitted that the accommodation did substantially burden religious exercise and was illegal under RFRA.</p>\r\n<p>On March 7, 2018, the Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for a permanent injunction. The Court permanently enjoined the government from enforcing the mandate against CBA members, their health plans, their health insurance issuers, or third-party administrators in connection with their health plans, to the extent that it required CBA members to contract, arrange, pay, or refer for religiously-objectionable medical care. The Court also declared that the mandate violated RFRA. In August, 2018, the Court awarded the plaintiffs $699,725.95 in attorneys' fees and $18,881.41 in expenses not recoverable under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1920. The case is now closed.</p>",

              "transformed_text": "The story of the Catholic Benefits Association (CBA) and the Catholic Insurance Company's legal challenge began on July 1, 2014, when they launched a lawsuit. Their purpose was to protect their members from the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) contraceptive mandate, which they believed forced them to violate their deeply held religious principles. They contended that merely notifying the government of their religious objection initiated a chain of events that led their employees to receive contraceptive services, thereby implicating them in practices contrary to their faith. This lawsuit was a direct assertion of their rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the First Amendment, seeking to halt what they saw as an unconstitutional infringement on their religious freedom.\n\nThis was not their first legal endeavor; an earlier suit had already secured an injunction for their then-current members. This new lawsuit was strategically initiated to extend that crucial protection to additional employers who had since joined the association, ensuring a broader shield against the mandate's requirements. The Catholic Insurance Company, however, found itself unable to pursue its own claims, as the court in the prior case had determined it lacked the necessary standing.\n\nThe court responded by granting a preliminary injunction in December 2014, a vital, albeit temporary, victory for the CBA. This ruling provided immediate relief for current nonprofit religious employers and closely held for-profit members, preventing federal enforcement of the mandate against them. However, the court carefully limited the scope of this early protection, declining to extend it to future members, certain exempt religious employers, or the Catholic Insurance Company, indicating a cautious approach to the breadth of the religious exemption.\n\nThe partial nature of this preliminary victory led both sides to appeal the decision in early 2015. The plaintiffs sought to broaden the injunction, while the government likely aimed to overturn it. However, the Tenth Circuit, recognizing that the Supreme Court was poised to rule on similar cases, strategically put this case on hold. This pause allowed the higher court to resolve the fundamental legal questions surrounding the contraceptive mandate's religious accommodation, a decision that would ultimately guide the resolution of this and many related challenges.\n\nThe legal landscape shifted dramatically by October 2017. Following the Supreme Court's consideration of related cases, the government itself issued new rules, effectively conceding that the contraceptive mandate's accommodation *did* substantially burden religious exercise and was illegal under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Seizing this critical development, the plaintiffs strategically moved to dismiss their appeals, as the government's admission had largely validated their core argument. This cleared the path for them to seek a permanent injunction, aiming for a definitive and lasting resolution to their long-standing grievance.\n\nThis strategic pursuit culminated in a decisive victory on March 7, 2018. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion, permanently enjoining the government from enforcing the mandate against CBA members to the extent it compelled them to facilitate religiously objectionable medical care. This ruling not only declared the mandate a violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act but also provided a lasting safeguard for the religious liberty of the association's members. The subsequent award of attorneys' fees in August 2018 further underscored the successful vindication of their rights, bringing this significant chapter in legal history to a close.",

They felt caught in an impossible situation: simply notifying the government of their religious objection set in motion a chain of events that led to services they found morally wrong. This wasn't just a policy; it was a profound challenge to their conscience, forcing them to choose between their faith and following the law. Even the Catholic Insurance Company, which initially joined this fight, found its path forward blocked, but the larger group pressed on.\n\nUnable to reconcile their faith with the government's demand, these organizations, led by the Catholic Benefits Association, decided they had no choice but to seek help. They turned to the legal system, arguing that this requirement was an unfair burden on their religious freedom and was implemented improperly. Their plea was for the right to live and work in accordance with their deeply held convictions, without being forced to facilitate practices that violated their core identity.\n\nAfter a long and uncertain journey, marked by temporary protections and pauses as the highest courts considered similar issues, a significant turning point arrived. The government itself, acknowledging the profound impact of its rule, admitted that the requirement indeed placed an unfair burden on religious practice. This pivotal admission paved the way for a lasting resolution. In a moment of profound relief, a court definitively sided with the Catholic employers. This outcome not only freed them from the obligation to facilitate medical care that went against their faith, but it also secured a permanent safeguard for their religious liberty, ensuring they would never again face such a dilemma. The victory even meant their long struggle was financially supported, with the court covering their legal costs.",

Defendants move to preclude the report and testimony of Plaintiff's expert, Dr. Donna Lopiano, before her deposition on relevance and reliability grounds. Defendants do not argue that Dr. Lopiano, who, among other things, holds a Ph.D. in Physical Education, co-authored the Athletic Director's Desk Reference (2013), served in various administrative capacities at colleges and universities throughout the nation, and testified in court previously, is unqualified to serve as an expert. Rather, Defendants argue that Dr. Lopiano's opinions should be excluded under Federal Rules of Evidence 403, 701, and 702. In support of their motion, Defendants submit an incomplete version of Dr. Lopiano's draft report (e.g., referring to but not including exhibit MM), but not the report in its entirety.

Because of his previous experience, and knowledge of this case, and because it had been previously referred to him, the Court referred this matter to the Honorable Judge William I. Garfinkel, a U.S. Magistrate Judge on recall. Judge Garfinkel has had a distinguished career, and is a renowned mediator of legal matters of all kinds, and this Court has no doubt that this case, in its new posture, could benefit from his considerable expertise once again. As a result, at least in this instance, the parties' suggestion of \"a fresh set of eyes [as] more likely to be conducive to a productive, constructive, and ultimately successful settlement conference,\" Motion to Refer at 1, ECF No. 129, is misguided, at best. Nevertheless, because the Court will not waste Judge Garfinkel's precious time, as a recalled Magistrate Judge, with parties who have unnecessarily prejudged him, although the Court has no doubt Judge Garfinkel has not and would not prejudge them, the Court will grant the motion for a referral. But, because the District of Connecticut no longer has a system of pairing judges by courthouse location, this matter will be placed in the wheel for a new assignment. Signed by Judge Victor A. Bolden on 3/18/2023. (Bartlett, H) (Entered: 03/18/2023)"

Because the parties will likely be ordered to attend the conference, either in-person or via videoconference, counsel are instructed to obtain their client's schedules over the next ninety days and have them available during the pre-conference. Counsel should also have their own calendars available to aid in scheduling. During the telephone call, counsel should be prepared to discuss what, if any, information needs to be exchanged and anything else that needs to be accomplished prior to the settlement conference to maximize its chances of success.If either counsel has a firm, unavoidable conflict at the appointed date and time, e.g., a previously-scheduled appearance in another court, s/he should not file a motion for continuance on the docket but rather should call Chambers at 860-240-3605 as soon as possible with opposing counsel on the line to work out an alternate day and time for the pre-conference with Judge Farrish's law clerk.

This lawsuit arose from the student&rsquo;s removal from the women&rsquo;s soccer team and the termination of her one-year athletic scholarship following a hand gesture made during celebrations on the soccer field after victory that was broadcast on television and online. The individual student plaintiff filed lawsuit pro se but was represented by private counsel shortly thereafter and alleged violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments; Title IX; and state law contract and tort claims. Plaintiff sought declaratory relief as well as compensatory and punitive damages.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 5, 2017, defendants moved to partially dismiss the complaint. On December 14, 2017, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss. The court reasoned that only the Title IX claim could proceed against the Board of Trustees because all &sect;1983 claims against the Board were alleged in their official capacity, which was not workable because the Board was not a \"person\" in the statute's contemplation. The court also determined that the plaintiff&rsquo;s constitutional and state law claims could proceed against the three university employees but only as to their individual capacities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After discovery and failed settlement talks, the defendants moved for summary judgment on November 1, 2019. On December 23, 2019, the plaintiff filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment on her constitutional claims. On June 6, 2020, judge granted the defendants&rsquo; motion for summary judgment on all remaining claims and denied plaintiff&rsquo;s motion for summary judgement. Regarding the plaintiff&rsquo;s Title IX claim, the court reasoned that the defendants had established a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for termination. The court additionally held that the plaintiff did not show sufficient personal involvement by the university employees for her equal protection claim or that her scholarship was a constitutionally protected property interest for her due process claim. As to the plaintiff&rsquo;s free speech claim, the court recognized that her gesture was protected speech but that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. Finally, the court noted that the plaintiff had conceded that her state law claims lacked merit. 65 F. Supp. 3d 75.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff appealed part of the district court&rsquo;s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on July 3, 2020. Specifically, the plaintiff appealed the district court&rsquo;s grant of summary judgment as to her due process, free speech, and Title IX claims. The appellate court affirmed the district court&rsquo;s decision regarding the free speech claim. As for the procedural due process claim, the appellate court disagreed with the district court and held that her scholarship was a constitutionally protected property interest, but the Second Circuit then found that the defendants enjoyed qualified immunity as to this claim.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, the appellate court disagreed with the district court&rsquo;s decision to grant summary judgment in favor of the university on the Title IX claim. The appellate court found that, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a rational jury could find that her gender played a role in the termination of her scholarship. Specifically, the plaintiff provided proof of more preferable treatment of male students after misconduct as well as the inconsistent reasons for termination of plaintiff&rsquo;s scholarship by UConn officials. 55 F.4th 101. The case was remanded to the district court. As of February 17, 2023, this case in ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

This lawsuit arose from the student&rsquo;s removal from the women&rsquo;s soccer team and the termination of her one-year athletic scholarship following a hand gesture made during celebrations on the soccer field after victory that was broadcast on television and online. The individual student plaintiff filed lawsuit pro se but was represented by private counsel shortly thereafter and alleged violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments; Title IX; and state law contract and tort claims. Plaintiff sought declaratory relief as well as compensatory and punitive damages.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 5, 2017, defendants moved to partially dismiss the complaint. On December 14, 2017, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss. The court reasoned that only the Title IX claim could proceed against the Board of Trustees because all &sect;1983 claims against the Board were alleged in their official capacity, which was not workable because the Board was not a \"person\" in the statute's contemplation. The court also determined that the plaintiff&rsquo;s constitutional and state law claims could proceed against the three university employees but only as to their individual capacities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After discovery and failed settlement talks, the defendants moved for summary judgment on November 1, 2019. On December 23, 2019, the plaintiff filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment on her constitutional claims. On June 6, 2020, judge granted the defendants&rsquo; motion for summary judgment on all remaining claims and denied plaintiff&rsquo;s motion for summary judgement. Regarding the plaintiff&rsquo;s Title IX claim, the court reasoned that the defendants had established a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for termination. The court additionally held that the plaintiff did not show sufficient personal involvement by the university employees for her equal protection claim or that her scholarship was a constitutionally protected property interest for her due process claim. As to the plaintiff&rsquo;s free speech claim, the court recognized that her gesture was protected speech but that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. Finally, the court noted that the plaintiff had conceded that her state law claims lacked merit. 65 F. Supp. 3d 75.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff appealed part of the district court&rsquo;s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on July 3, 2020. Specifically, the plaintiff appealed the district court&rsquo;s grant of summary judgment as to her due process, free speech, and Title IX claims. The appellate court affirmed the district court&rsquo;s decision regarding the free speech claim. As for the procedural due process claim, the appellate court disagreed with the district court and held that her scholarship was a constitutionally protected property interest, but the Second Circuit then found that the defendants enjoyed qualified immunity as to this claim.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, the appellate court disagreed with the district court&rsquo;s decision to grant summary judgment in favor of the university on the Title IX claim. The appellate court found that, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a rational jury could find that her gender played a role in the termination of her scholarship. Specifically, the plaintiff provided proof of more preferable treatment of male students after misconduct as well as the inconsistent reasons for termination of plaintiff&rsquo;s scholarship by UConn officials. 55 F.4th 101. The case was remanded to the district court. As of February 17, 2023, this case in ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

              "transformed_text": "Imagine a student at the University of Connecticut (UConn) who, on December 19, 2016, decided to take her school to federal court in Connecticut. She sued the UConn Board of Trustees (think of them as the school's main governing body) and three people who worked for the university. Why? Because she was kicked off the women's soccer team and lost her one-year sports scholarship. This all happened after she made a hand gesture during a soccer celebration that was seen on TV and online. At first, she filed the lawsuit by herself, but then she got a private lawyer to help her. She said the university had violated her rights under several important laws: the First Amendment (which protects free speech), the Fourteenth Amendment (which ensures everyone is treated fairly and gets a fair process before losing something important), and Title IX (a law that stops schools from discriminating based on sex). She also claimed the school broke its contract with her and caused her personal harm, according to state laws. She asked the court to declare that her rights were indeed violated, and she wanted money to cover her losses, plus extra money to punish the university.\n\nOn June 5, 2017, the university and its staff asked the court to throw out some of the student's claims. On December 14, 2017, the court agreed to get rid of some claims but let others continue. The judge said that only the claim about sex discrimination (Title IX) could go forward against the Board of Trustees. This was because, for the other claims, the student was essentially suing the Board as if it *was* the university, and the law didn't see the Board as a \"person\" who could be sued in that way for those specific claims. However, the court decided that the student's claims about her constitutional rights and state laws *could* continue against the three university employees, but only against them as individuals, not as if they were the university itself.\n\nAfter both sides gathered information (like talking to witnesses and looking at documents) and couldn't agree to settle the case, the university and staff asked the court on November 1, 2019, to decide the case in their favor without needing a full trial. This kind of request is called \"summary judgment.\" On December 23, 2019, the student also asked the court to rule in *her* favor on some of her constitutional claims. But on June 6, 2020, the judge sided with the university and its staff on all the claims that were left, and said no to the student's request. For the student's claim about sex discrimination (Title IX), the court decided that the university and staff had a good, fair reason for ending her scholarship that wasn't about discrimination. The court also said the student didn't show enough proof that the university staff were directly involved in treating her unfairly (which relates to \"equal protection\"). And she didn't prove that her scholarship was a \"protected right\" under the Constitution, which would have meant the school had to follow certain fair steps (\"due process\") before taking it away. When it came to her free speech claim, the court agreed that her gesture *was* a form of protected speech. However, the court also said that the university staff were protected by something called \"qualified immunity.\" This basically means they couldn't be held responsible because their actions weren't a clear violation of a law that was already established. Finally, the court pointed out that the student herself had admitted her claims under state law weren't very strong.\n\nThe student wasn't happy with some of these decisions, so on July 3, 2020, she appealed them to a higher court, called the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. She specifically challenged the lower court's decisions against her regarding her right to a fair process (\"due process\"), her free speech, and the sex discrimination law (Title IX). The appeals court agreed with the lower court's decision about the free speech claim. But for the \"due process\" claim, the appeals court disagreed with the lower court. It said that her scholarship *was* indeed a protected right under the Constitution. However, the appeals court then decided that the university staff were *still* protected by \"qualified immunity\" for this claim too.\n\nFinally, the appeals court disagreed with the lower court's decision to side with the university on the Title IX (sex discrimination) claim. The appeals court said that if you looked at all the evidence in the way most favorable to the student, a reasonable jury (like a group of your peers) could believe that her gender played a part in why her scholarship was taken away. Specifically, the student showed proof that male students who did similar things were treated better, and that UConn officials kept changing their reasons for ending her scholarship. Because of this, the case was sent back to the original district court to be looked at again and continue. As of February 17, 2023, this case is still going on.",

              "transformed_text": "A student at UConn sued her school on December 19, 2016. She sued UConn's main leaders and three school workers. This happened because she was removed from the women's soccer team. She also lost her sports scholarship. This was after she made a hand sign during a soccer party that was seen on TV.\n\nShe first sued by herself, then got a lawyer. She said the school broke her rights. These rights included free speech, fair treatment, and not being treated differently because she was a girl (Title IX). She also said the school broke its promise to her and hurt her. She wanted the court to say her rights were broken. She also wanted money for what she lost and extra money to punish the school.\n\nOn June 5, 2017, the school and its workers asked the court to stop some of the student's claims. On December 14, 2017, the court said yes to stopping some claims. But it let others go on. The judge said only the claim about being treated unfairly because she was a girl (Title IX) could go against the school's leaders. This was because, for other claims, the law didn't see the leaders as a \"person\" who could be sued in that way. But the court said the student's claims about her rights and state laws *could* go on against the three school workers. This was only against them as people, not as if they were the school.\n\nBoth sides gathered facts. They talked to people and looked at papers. They could not agree to end the case. So, on November 1, 2019, the school and its workers asked the court to decide the case for them. They wanted to do this without a full trial. This is called \"summary judgment.\" On December 23, 2019, the student also asked the court to rule for *her* on some of her rights claims. But on June 6, 2020, the judge agreed with the school and its workers. All the remaining claims went their way. The judge said no to the student's request.\n\nFor the claim about being treated unfairly because she was a girl (Title IX), the court said the school had a good reason to end her scholarship. It was not about unfair treatment. The court also said the student didn't show enough proof that the school workers were directly involved in treating her unfairly. And she didn't prove her scholarship was a \"protected right\" under the law. If it was, the school would have had to follow fair steps before taking it away. For her free speech claim, the court agreed her hand sign *was* protected speech. But the court also said the school workers were protected by \"qualified immunity.\" This means they couldn't be blamed. Their actions were not a clear break of a law that was already set. Last, the court said the student herself agreed her state law claims were not strong.\n\nThe student was not happy. So on July 3, 2020, she asked a higher court to look at the case again. This court was called the U.S. Court of Appeals. She said the lower court was wrong about her right to a fair process, her free speech, and the unfair treatment law (Title IX). The appeals court agreed with the lower court about the free speech claim. But for the \"fair process\" claim, the appeals court did not agree. It said her scholarship *was* a protected right under the law. But the appeals court then said the school workers were *still* protected by \"qualified immunity\" for this claim too.\n\nFinally, the appeals court did not agree with the lower court about the unfair treatment claim (Title IX). The appeals court said if you looked at all the facts in the student's favor, a fair group of people (a jury) could think her gender was why her scholarship was taken away. She showed that boys who did similar things were treated better. Also, school leaders kept changing their reasons for ending her scholarship. Because of this, the case was sent back to the first court. It will be looked at again and continue. As of February 17, 2023, this case is still happening.",

This lawsuit arose from the student&rsquo;s removal from the women&rsquo;s soccer team and the termination of her one-year athletic scholarship following a hand gesture made during celebrations on the soccer field after victory that was broadcast on television and online. The individual student plaintiff filed lawsuit pro se but was represented by private counsel shortly thereafter and alleged violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments; Title IX; and state law contract and tort claims. Plaintiff sought declaratory relief as well as compensatory and punitive damages.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 5, 2017, defendants moved to partially dismiss the complaint. On December 14, 2017, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss. The court reasoned that only the Title IX claim could proceed against the Board of Trustees because all &sect;1983 claims against the Board were alleged in their official capacity, which was not workable because the Board was not a \"person\" in the statute's contemplation. The court also determined that the plaintiff&rsquo;s constitutional and state law claims could proceed against the three university employees but only as to their individual capacities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After discovery and failed settlement talks, the defendants moved for summary judgment on November 1, 2019. On December 23, 2019, the plaintiff filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment on her constitutional claims. On June 6, 2020, judge granted the defendants&rsquo; motion for summary judgment on all remaining claims and denied plaintiff&rsquo;s motion for summary judgement. Regarding the plaintiff&rsquo;s Title IX claim, the court reasoned that the defendants had established a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for termination. The court additionally held that the plaintiff did not show sufficient personal involvement by the university employees for her equal protection claim or that her scholarship was a constitutionally protected property interest for her due process claim. As to the plaintiff&rsquo;s free speech claim, the court recognized that her gesture was protected speech but that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. Finally, the court noted that the plaintiff had conceded that her state law claims lacked merit. 65 F. Supp. 3d 75.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff appealed part of the district court&rsquo;s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on July 3, 2020. Specifically, the plaintiff appealed the district court&rsquo;s grant of summary judgment as to her due process, free speech, and Title IX claims. The appellate court affirmed the district court&rsquo;s decision regarding the free speech claim. As for the procedural due process claim, the appellate court disagreed with the district court and held that her scholarship was a constitutionally protected property interest, but the Second Circuit then found that the defendants enjoyed qualified immunity as to this claim.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, the appellate court disagreed with the district court&rsquo;s decision to grant summary judgment in favor of the university on the Title IX claim. The appellate court found that, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a rational jury could find that her gender played a role in the termination of her scholarship. Specifically, the plaintiff provided proof of more preferable treatment of male students after misconduct as well as the inconsistent reasons for termination of plaintiff&rsquo;s scholarship by UConn officials. 55 F.4th 101. The case was remanded to the district court. As of February 17, 2023, this case in ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

              "transformed_text": "In December 2016, a female student from the University of Connecticut initiated a legal challenge in federal court against the university and several of its employees. This lawsuit arose from a significant personal setback: her removal from the women's soccer team and the termination of her athletic scholarship. This severe disciplinary action followed a hand gesture she made during televised post-victory celebrations, which she believed was an unjust and discriminatory response. Through her lawsuit, she sought to vindicate her rights, alleging violations of constitutional protections, federal anti-discrimination law (Title IX), and state contract and tort principles, all aimed at securing declaratory relief and damages for the harm she suffered.\n\nFacing a broad array of claims, the university and its employees strategically moved to partially dismiss the complaint in June 2017. Their purpose was to narrow the scope of the litigation, seeking to eliminate claims they argued were legally unfounded or improperly brought against certain parties, thereby aiming to streamline the case and limit their potential liability. The court's subsequent ruling in December 2017 partially granted this motion, allowing the Title IX claim to proceed against the Board of Trustees while permitting constitutional and state law claims against the individual employees, thus shaping the specific legal battleground.\n\nAfter a period of extensive information gathering (discovery) and unsuccessful attempts to reach an out-of-court settlement, both sides sought a definitive resolution without a full trial. The defendants moved for summary judgment in November 2019, attempting to conclude the entire case in their favor by asserting that the student's claims lacked sufficient factual support to warrant a jury's consideration. Conversely, the student filed her own cross-motion for partial summary judgment in December 2019, aiming to secure a victory on her constitutional claims by arguing the facts clearly supported her position. In June 2020, the court largely sided with the university, granting their motion for summary judgment on all remaining claims and denying the student's, concluding that she had not presented enough compelling evidence to proceed to trial on most of her allegations, including her Title IX, equal protection, due process, and free speech claims.\n\nUnwilling to accept the district court's comprehensive dismissal, the student appealed a portion of the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in July 2020. Her purpose in appealing was to persuade a higher court that the initial judge had erred in dismissing her claims, particularly those concerning her fundamental rights and alleged discrimination. The appellate court's review served as a crucial check on the lower court's judgment. While it affirmed the dismissal of her free speech claim and ultimately found qualified immunity for her due process claim (despite agreeing her scholarship was a protected interest), it significantly disagreed with the district court's decision on the Title IX claim. The appellate court found that, based on the evidence, a rational jury could indeed conclude that her gender played a role in the termination of her scholarship, citing evidence of more favorable treatment for male students after misconduct and inconsistent reasons provided by university officials for her termination. This pivotal reversal sent the case back to the district court, ensuring that the student's central claim of discrimination would continue to be litigated, a process that remains ongoing as of February 2023.",

This comes after the university removed her from the women's soccer team and ended her athletic scholarship following a hand gesture she made during a post-victory celebration.\n\nInitially, the university's position was largely upheld, with a lower court finding insufficient evidence for her claims, including those related to free speech, due process, and equal protection. However, the appellate court critically reviewed this. While it agreed with some dismissals, it strongly disagreed with the decision regarding her Title IX claim. The court found that a jury could reasonably conclude that her gender influenced the scholarship termination. This finding was supported by evidence suggesting male students involved in misconduct received more favorable treatment, and that the university provided inconsistent reasons for her termination.\n\nThis pivotal ruling means her Title IX claim will now proceed, ensuring a deeper examination into whether the university adhered to federal anti-discrimination law. This ongoing case highlights the critical importance of fair and equitable treatment for all student-athletes, regardless of gender.",

After a triumphant game, she made a simple hand gesture during the celebration, and for this, the university took away her spot on the team and ended her athletic scholarship.\n\nFeeling deeply wronged and believing her gender played a role in this harsh decision, she sought help to challenge the university's actions. She pointed to instances where male students involved in similar misconduct were treated more favorably, and highlighted how the university's explanations for her dismissal seemed to change over time. Initially, her efforts to prove unfair treatment were dismissed.\n\nBut she didn't give up. Her story was heard again, and this time, a higher authority saw things differently. They recognized that there was enough evidence to suggest her gender might have influenced the university's decision to end her scholarship. This means her case will now be fully examined, ensuring a thorough look into whether the university treated her fairly, just like any other student-athlete.",
