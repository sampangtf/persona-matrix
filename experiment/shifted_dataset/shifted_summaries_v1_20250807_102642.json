The DOJ&rsquo;s investigation found that CVH regularly failed to: (1) adequately protect patients from harm and undue restraints; (2) provide adequate psychiatric and psychological services; and (3) ensure adequate discharge planning and placement in the most integrated setting appropriate to each patient&rsquo;s individualized needs. The report formally put CVH on notice that failure to improve conditions would result in a lawsuit.</p>\r\n<p>On January 20, 2009, the Department of Justice filed suit against the state of Connecticut and its Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services in U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut for the aforementioned pattern of practices at CVH, that violated the constitutional and federal statutory rights of patients under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1997 (CRIPA). The lawsuit was filed along with a settlement agreement and joint motion to dismiss. &nbsp;Judge Alvin W. Thompson approved the settlement on July 8, 2009 and conditionally dismissed the suit.</p>\r\n<p>In the settlement, Connecticut agreed to a wide variety of practice changes and a period of supervised operation. The state agreed to provide care and treatment &ldquo;based on professional standards of practice that shall seek to: A. ameliorate symptoms such that a less restrictive locus of treatment may safely be employed; B. strengthen and support individuals&rsquo; rehabilitation and recovery; and C. enable individuals and grow and develop in ways benefiting their health and well-being.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The settlement called for an environment that maximizes safety and is predicated on respect between the staff and those whom they serve. In addition, it mandated implementation of integrated treatment plans and interdisciplinary staff teams to increase the efficacy of treatment provided. Furthermore, the settlement outlined extensive changes in the psychiatric and psychological care provided in order to increase the safety and wellbeing of patients while also reducing the risk of harm and suicide that was extensive at CVH. Across the board, the settlement emphasized that care provided be consistent with generally accepted professional standards of care and that the environment at CVH be sufficiently humane to reduce the risk of harm. The settlement outlined a 48-month period of supervised implementation after which the agreement would terminate provided that CVH had demonstrated substantial compliance with the terms.</p>\r\n<p>On September 25, 2013, the Court approved a notice of substantial compliance with certain terms of the settlement agreement and extension of termination that was filed by the State. On May 22, 2015, the Court approved the State&rsquo;s notice of substantial compliance and motion to terminate the settlement agreement, effectively terminating the Court&rsquo;s ability to enforce the agreement.</p>\r\n<p>Although the notice of substantial compliance and motion to terminate was accepted and granted, news suggests that as late as mid-2017, patients at the Connecticut Valley Hospital continued to suffer from widespread abuse.

The DOJ&rsquo;s investigation found that CVH regularly failed to: (1) adequately protect patients from harm and undue restraints; (2) provide adequate psychiatric and psychological services; and (3) ensure adequate discharge planning and placement in the most integrated setting appropriate to each patient&rsquo;s individualized needs. The report formally put CVH on notice that failure to improve conditions would result in a lawsuit.</p>\r\n<p>On January 20, 2009, the Department of Justice filed suit against the state of Connecticut and its Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services in U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut for the aforementioned pattern of practices at CVH, that violated the constitutional and federal statutory rights of patients under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1997 (CRIPA). The lawsuit was filed along with a settlement agreement and joint motion to dismiss. &nbsp;Judge Alvin W. Thompson approved the settlement on July 8, 2009 and conditionally dismissed the suit.</p>\r\n<p>In the settlement, Connecticut agreed to a wide variety of practice changes and a period of supervised operation. The state agreed to provide care and treatment &ldquo;based on professional standards of practice that shall seek to: A. ameliorate symptoms such that a less restrictive locus of treatment may safely be employed; B. strengthen and support individuals&rsquo; rehabilitation and recovery; and C. enable individuals and grow and develop in ways benefiting their health and well-being.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The settlement called for an environment that maximizes safety and is predicated on respect between the staff and those whom they serve. In addition, it mandated implementation of integrated treatment plans and interdisciplinary staff teams to increase the efficacy of treatment provided. Furthermore, the settlement outlined extensive changes in the psychiatric and psychological care provided in order to increase the safety and wellbeing of patients while also reducing the risk of harm and suicide that was extensive at CVH. Across the board, the settlement emphasized that care provided be consistent with generally accepted professional standards of care and that the environment at CVH be sufficiently humane to reduce the risk of harm. The settlement outlined a 48-month period of supervised implementation after which the agreement would terminate provided that CVH had demonstrated substantial compliance with the terms.</p>\r\n<p>On September 25, 2013, the Court approved a notice of substantial compliance with certain terms of the settlement agreement and extension of termination that was filed by the State. On May 22, 2015, the Court approved the State&rsquo;s notice of substantial compliance and motion to terminate the settlement agreement, effectively terminating the Court&rsquo;s ability to enforce the agreement.</p>\r\n<p>Although the notice of substantial compliance and motion to terminate was accepted and granted, news suggests that as late as mid-2017, patients at the Connecticut Valley Hospital continued to suffer from widespread abuse.

CVH is the biggest of Connecticut's five mental health hospitals run by the state. They did this under a law called the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), which is designed to protect people in places like hospitals and prisons.\n\nThey sent a report with what they found to Connecticut's governor on August 6, 2007. The DOJ's investigation showed that CVH often didn't do a good job of: (1) keeping patients safe from harm or from being held back too much; (2) giving them enough mental health care; and (3) helping them plan to leave the hospital and live as independently as possible. The report was a formal warning to CVH: if things didn't improve, the government would sue them.\n\nOn January 20, 2009, the Department of Justice took the state of Connecticut and its mental health department to court. The lawsuit said that what CVH was doing went against patients' basic rights under the Constitution and federal laws, specifically CRIPA. They filed the lawsuit, but also included a suggested agreement to settle the case, and asked the judge to close the lawsuit right away. Judge Alvin W. Thompson approved this agreement on July 8, 2009. He closed the lawsuit, but with certain conditions that the state had to meet.\n\nIn this agreement, Connecticut promised to make many changes to how it ran things and agreed to be watched for a period of time. The state agreed to give care and treatment that met professional standards. This care would aim to: A. reduce patients' symptoms so they could get help in less controlled environments; B. help people get better and recover; and C. allow them to grow and improve their overall health.\n\nThe agreement also said the hospital had to be as safe as possible and that staff and patients should treat each other with respect. It also required using complete treatment plans and having teams of staff from different areas work together to make care better. Plus, it laid out big changes for mental health care. These changes were meant to make patients safer and healthier, and to lower the high risk of harm and suicide that was common at CVH. Overall, the agreement emphasized that all care had to meet accepted professional standards and that the hospital environment needed to be kind and safe enough to reduce the risk of harm. The agreement set a 48-month (four-year) period for these changes to be watched closely. After this time, the agreement would end if CVH proved it had mostly followed the rules.\n\nOn September 25, 2013, the court agreed to a notice from the State saying it had mostly followed some parts of the agreement, and they extended the deadline for the agreement to end. Then, on May 22, 2015, the court approved the State's claim that it had largely met the requirements and its request to end the agreement. This meant the court could no longer make sure the agreement was being followed.\n\nEven though the court said the State had mostly followed the rules and ended the agreement, news reports from mid-2017 showed that patients at Connecticut Valley Hospital were still suffering from a lot of abuse. On September 6, 2017, the Connecticut State Police announced that nine CVH employees were arrested. Their charges included cruelty to people and disorderly conduct. News stories from the Associated Press and a local TV station (Channel 3 Eyewitness News) described violence, humiliation, and sexual harassment that patients experienced from CVH employees.",

CVH was the biggest state hospital for people with mental health issues in Connecticut. The government used a special law. It's called CRIPA. This law helps protect people in places like hospitals and prisons.\n\nThe government sent a report about what they found. They sent it to Connecticut's governor on August 6, 2007. The report said CVH often did not do a good job. They didn't keep patients safe from harm. They held patients back too much. They didn't give patients enough mental health care. They also didn't help patients plan to leave. Patients needed help to live on their own after the hospital. The report was a serious warning. It said if CVH didn't get better, the government would sue them.\n\nOn January 20, 2009, the Department of Justice sued Connecticut. They also sued the state's mental health department. The lawsuit said CVH was breaking patients' basic rights. These rights are protected by the Constitution and federal laws like CRIPA. The government filed the lawsuit. But they also offered a way to settle the problem. They asked the judge to close the case right away. Judge Alvin W. Thompson said yes to this plan. This was on July 8, 2009. He closed the lawsuit. But Connecticut had to follow certain rules.\n\nIn this agreement, Connecticut promised to change how the hospital worked. The state also agreed to be watched for a while. They said they would give care that was up to professional standards. This care would help patients in three ways. First, it would make their problems less severe. This way, they could get help in places that were not so strict. Second, it would help people get better and heal. Third, it would help them grow and feel healthier overall.\n\nThe agreement also said the hospital had to be very safe. Staff and patients should treat each other with respect. The hospital had to use full plans for how to treat each patient. Teams of different staff members had to work together. This was to make care better. The agreement also planned big changes for mental health care. These changes were to make patients safer and healthier. They also aimed to lower the high risk of harm and suicide at CVH. The agreement said all care must be professional and good. The hospital place itself needed to be kind and safe. This would help lower the risk of harm. The state had four years, or 48 months, to make these changes. They would be watched closely during this time. After four years, the agreement would end. But only if CVH showed it had followed most of the rules.\n\nOn September 25, 2013, the court agreed with Connecticut. The state said it had followed some parts of the agreement. So, the court gave them more time to finish. Then, on May 22, 2015, the court said okay again. Connecticut said it had mostly done what it promised. They asked the court to end the agreement. The court agreed. This meant the court could no longer check if the rules were being followed.\n\nBut even after the court ended the agreement, bad things were still happening. News reports from mid-2017 showed patients at CVH were still being hurt. They suffered a lot of abuse. On September 6, 2017, police announced arrests. Nine workers from CVH were arrested. They were charged with being cruel to people. They were also charged with causing trouble. News stories said workers were violent. They made patients feel ashamed. They also sexually harassed patients.",

The report formally put CVH on notice that failure to improve conditions would result in a lawsuit.</p>\r\n<p>On January 20, 2009, the Department of Justice filed suit against the state of Connecticut and its Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services in U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut for the aforementioned pattern of practices at CVH, that violated the constitutional and federal statutory rights of patients under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1997 (CRIPA).

In addition, it mandated implementation of integrated treatment plans and interdisciplinary staff teams to increase the efficacy of treatment provided. Furthermore, the settlement outlined extensive changes in the psychiatric and psychological care provided in order to increase the safety and wellbeing of patients while also reducing the risk of harm and suicide that was extensive at CVH. Across the board, the settlement emphasized that care provided be consistent with generally accepted professional standards of care and that the environment at CVH be sufficiently humane to reduce the risk of harm. The settlement outlined a 48-month period of supervised implementation after which the agreement would terminate provided that CVH had demonstrated substantial compliance with the terms.</p>\r\n<p>On September 25, 2013, the Court approved a notice of substantial compliance with certain terms of the settlement agreement and extension of termination that was filed by the State.

              "transformed_text": "As a Legal Historian, I observe that the story of Connecticut Valley Hospital (CVH) began on December 19, 2005, when the Department of Justice (DOJ), Civil Rights Division, launched an investigation. This was a proactive step, taken under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), to determine if the state's largest psychiatric hospital was failing its patients.\n\nThe investigation's findings, delivered to Connecticut's governor on August 6, 2007, revealed deeply troubling conditions: patients were inadequately protected from harm and undue restraints, psychiatric and psychological services were deficient, and discharge planning was insufficient. This report served as a formal warning, a diplomatic attempt to prompt voluntary improvements and avert a lawsuit.\n\nHowever, when these issues persisted, the DOJ concluded that formal legal intervention was necessary. On January 20, 2009, they filed suit against the state of Connecticut and its Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services. This lawsuit aimed to compel the state to address the pattern of practices at CVH that violated patients' constitutional and federal statutory rights under CRIPA. Significantly, the parties had already negotiated a comprehensive solution, as the lawsuit was filed concurrently with a settlement agreement and a joint request to dismiss the case. This strategic move allowed for an immediate resolution, bypassing protracted litigation, and enabling swift implementation of reforms under judicial oversight. Judge Alvin W. Thompson approved this settlement on July 8, 2009, conditionally closing the case while retaining the court's power to enforce the agreement.\n\nThe settlement itself was a detailed blueprint for reform. Connecticut committed to a wide array of practice changes and a period of supervised operation. The state agreed to uphold professional standards of care, focusing on symptom amelioration, rehabilitation, and patient well-being. It mandated an environment of safety and respect, integrated treatment plans, and interdisciplinary staff teams, all designed to enhance patient safety and reduce the pervasive risk of harm and suicide. This 48-month period of supervised implementation was intended to ensure the state's accountability and lasting systemic change.\n\nAs the supervised period progressed, on September 25, 2013, the state sought and received court approval for a notice of substantial compliance with certain terms, along with an extension, indicating the ongoing complexity of achieving full reform. Ultimately, on May 22, 2015, the state moved to terminate the agreement, asserting that it had achieved substantial compliance with the settlement's terms. The court approved this request, thereby ending its formal oversight and enforcement authority.\n\nYet, the historical record reveals a somber epilogue. Despite the legal intervention and the state's declaration of compliance, reports as late as mid-2017 suggested that patients at CVH continued to endure widespread abuse. This culminated on September 6, 2017, with the arrests of nine CVH employees on charges of cruelty to persons and disorderly conduct, with news reports detailing horrific instances of violence, humiliation, and sexual harassment. This unfortunate turn of events underscores the persistent challenges in safeguarding vulnerable populations, even after significant legal efforts.",

              "transformed_text": "The central legal conflict in this case revolved around whether the State of Connecticut was adequately protecting the constitutional and federal statutory rights of patients at Connecticut Valley Hospital (CVH), its largest psychiatric facility. Following an investigation that revealed serious deficiencies, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the state, which was promptly resolved by a court-approved settlement agreement.\n\nThe Department of Justice's investigation, initiated in 2005, found that CVH patients were inadequately protected from harm and undue restraints, received deficient psychiatric and psychological services, and lacked sufficient discharge planning. These findings led the DOJ to conclude that formal intervention was necessary to compel the state to uphold patients' rights under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA). The settlement, approved by the court, mandated extensive reforms. Connecticut committed to providing care based on professional standards, focusing on symptom amelioration, rehabilitation, and patient well-being. It required a safe and respectful environment, integrated treatment plans, and interdisciplinary staff teams to enhance patient safety and reduce the risk of harm and suicide. For 48 months, the state's implementation of these changes was supervised. Ultimately, in 2015, the court accepted the state's assertion of substantial compliance and ended its oversight. However, subsequent reports as late as mid-2017, culminating in the arrests of nine employees, revealed that patients continued to suffer widespread abuse, indicating the persistent challenges in safeguarding vulnerable individuals despite the legal intervention.",

In 2005, the Department of Justice, a federal group dedicated to protecting people's rights, began looking into the situation at CVH. What they uncovered by 2007 was grim: a pattern of harm and neglect.\n\nTo change this, in 2009, the Department of Justice took the state of Connecticut to task. Instead of a prolonged battle, they reached a powerful agreement, a commitment from the state to drastically improve conditions. Connecticut promised to provide care based on professional standards, focusing on helping patients recover, improving their well-being, and ensuring a safe, respectful environment.

By 2015, this period of close watch ended, with the state asserting it had fulfilled its promises. Yet, heartbreaking news emerged by mid-2017: patients at CVH continued to suffer widespread abuse, leading to the arrests of nine employees.

        "summary": "<p>On October 25, 2013, the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program (ADAP) filed this lawsuit in the District Court for the Southern District of Alabama. The plaintiff, which served as Alabama’s designated protection and advocacy program for people with disabilities, sued SafetyNet Youthcare, Inc. (SafetyNet) under the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act of 1986 (PAIMI), the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (PADD Act), and the Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Program of 1993 (PAIR). The plaintiff alleged that SafetyNet had unlawfully failed to allow it, as Alabama’s Protection and Advocacy (P&A) provider, to monitor the defendant's facilities. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had failed to grant ADAP access to facilities used for SafetyNet Academy, a program operated by the defendant for male youths with emotional or behavioral disabilities. The plaintiff claimed that, despite several attempts to explain to the staff at SafetyNet Academy why they were required by law to allow ADAP into all of the Academy's facilities for monitoring and investigation purposes, the defendant repeatedly refused to grant ADAP access to what it referred to as its Moderate Program. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and a preliminary injunction to compel the SafetyNet Academy to grant them reasonable access to the facilities.</p><p>On December 2, 2013 – the same day the defendant filed an answer denying that it was required to allow the plaintiff access to its Moderate Program – it also filed a third-party complaint against the Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR). SafetyNet claimed that, because it had acted on the advice and counsel of DHR, which served as its licensing authority, any potential violations on its own part were caused by DHR. On this basis, it sought indemnification from DHR for any recovery that may be received by the plaintiff against SafetyNet. </p><p>Unable to agree on terms of a settlement, the parties proceeded with discovery. On September 19, 2014, all three parties moved for summary judgment. While the plaintiff held onto its position that it was allowed access to all of SafetyNet Academy’s programs, the defendants argued that because the individuals in the Moderate Program had moderate (rather than severe) mental illness, they were excluded from P&A protection. </p><p>Shortly afterward, on October 14, 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) submitted a statement of interest supporting the plaintiff’s position that summary judgment against the defendants was appropriate. The DOJ asserted that the defendant’s facilities at SafetyNet Academy fell squarely within the parameters of PAIMI regulations and, as such, the plaintiff must be granted reasonable unrestricted access to all of the academy’s programs. </p><p>On December 12, 2014, Judge Callie V.S. Grande awarded summary judgment to the plaintiff, denying both defendants’ requests for summary judgment as well as SafetyNet’s request for indemnification and contribution against DHR. The judge found that, as a facility that provided residential treatment for individuals with mental illness and other disabilities, PAIMI, PADD, and PAIR applied to SafetyNet Academy. Rejecting defendants’ assertion that individuals with moderate mental illness may be excluded from P&A protection, she emphasized that the protections offered by these laws were intended to be broad in scope and did not define P&A access “one resident at a time.” Accordingly, Judge Grande held that ADAP was authorized to monitor all SafetyNet Academy programs and must be allowed reasonable access by law and awarded declaratory and permanent injunctive relief to the plaintiff. She also ordered ADAP and SafetyNet to meet and prepare a protocol for ADAP’s monitoring and investigation visits. Finally, the order denied SafetyNet’s request for indemnification against DHR and held that each party should bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs. 65 F.Supp.3d 1312.</p><p>The parties met and submitted access protocol on January 30, 2015. In addition to describing ADAP’s scope of access to SafetyNet and its records, the protocol outlined procedures ADAP may follow should SafetyNet deny or delay access to its facilities in the future. </p><p>Also following the grant of summary judgment, ADAP submitted a motion for reconsideration of the court’s denial of attorneys’ fees and costs. On February 11, 2015, Judge Grande issued an order awarding the plaintiff filing fees as the prevailing party. However, the order denied the plaintiff attorneys’ fees, citing a failure to raise an applicable exception to the American Rule stating that litigants are generally expected to bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs. 2015 WL 566946.</p>",

ADAP sued SafetyNet Youthcare, Inc. (SafetyNet) under the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act of 1986 (PAIMI), the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (PADD Act), and the Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Program of 1993 (PAIR). ADAP alleged that SafetyNet, as the operator of SafetyNet Academy—a program for male youths with emotional or behavioral disabilities—unlawfully failed to allow ADAP, as the state’s P&A provider, to monitor its facilities. Specifically, ADAP claimed SafetyNet repeatedly refused to grant access to what it referred to as its “Moderate Program,” despite several attempts by ADAP to explain the legal requirement for monitoring and investigation across all Academy facilities. ADAP sought declaratory relief and a preliminary injunction to compel SafetyNet Academy to grant reasonable access.\n\nOn December 2, 2013, SafetyNet filed an answer denying required access to its Moderate Program and simultaneously filed a third-party complaint against the Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR). SafetyNet contended that DHR, as its licensing authority, caused any potential violations by providing advice and counsel, and therefore sought indemnification from DHR for any recovery obtained by ADAP.\n\nFollowing unsuccessful settlement negotiations, the parties proceeded with discovery, after which all three parties moved for summary judgment. ADAP maintained its position that it was legally entitled to access all of SafetyNet Academy’s programs. Conversely, the defendants argued that individuals within the Moderate Program, possessing moderate rather than severe mental illness, were excluded from P&A protection.\n\nShortly thereafter, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) submitted a statement of interest supporting ADAP's position that summary judgment against the defendants was appropriate. The DOJ asserted that SafetyNet Academy facilities fell squarely within the parameters of PAIMI regulations, thereby mandating reasonable unrestricted access to all academy programs.\n\nOn December 12, 2014, Judge Callie V.S. Grande awarded summary judgment to ADAP, denying both defendants’ requests for summary judgment, as well as SafetyNet’s request for indemnification and contribution against DHR. The court determined that PAIMI, PADD, and PAIR applied to SafetyNet Academy, given its status as a facility providing residential treatment for individuals with mental illness and other disabilities. The judge rejected the defendants’ assertion that individuals with moderate mental illness could be excluded from P&A protection, emphasizing that these laws’ protections were intended to be broad in scope and did not define P&A access “one resident at a time.” Accordingly, Judge Grande held that ADAP was authorized to monitor all SafetyNet Academy programs and must be allowed reasonable access by law, awarding declaratory and permanent injunctive relief to the plaintiff. The order further directed ADAP and SafetyNet to meet and prepare a protocol for ADAP’s monitoring and investigation visits. Finally, the court denied SafetyNet’s request for indemnification against DHR and held that each party should bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs. 65 F.Supp.3d 1312.\n\nSubsequent to the court’s order, the parties met and submitted an access protocol. This protocol not only described ADAP’s scope of access to SafetyNet and its records, but also outlined specific procedures ADAP could follow should SafetyNet deny or delay access to its facilities in the future.\n\nAlso following the grant of summary judgment, ADAP submitted a motion for reconsideration of the court’s denial of attorneys’ fees and costs. On February 11, 2015, Judge Grande issued an order awarding ADAP filing fees as the prevailing party. However, the order denied ADAP attorneys’ fees, citing its failure to raise an applicable exception to the American Rule, which generally dictates that litigants bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs. 2015 WL 566946.",

(SafetyNet) under the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act of 1986 (PAIMI), the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (PADD Act), and the Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Program of 1993 (PAIR). ADAP alleged SafetyNet, as operator of SafetyNet Academy—a program for male youths with emotional or behavioral disabilities—unlawfully failed to allow ADAP, as the state’s P&A provider, to monitor its facilities. Specifically, ADAP claimed SafetyNet repeatedly refused access to its “Moderate Program,” despite ADAP’s attempts to explain the legal requirement for monitoring and investigation across all Academy facilities. ADAP sought declaratory relief and a preliminary injunction to compel SafetyNet Academy to grant reasonable access.\n\nOn December 2, 2013, SafetyNet answered, denying required access to its Moderate Program, and simultaneously filed a third-party complaint against the Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR). SafetyNet contended DHR, as its licensing authority, caused any potential violations by providing advice and counsel, and therefore sought indemnification from DHR for any recovery obtained by ADAP.\n\nAfter discovery and unsuccessful settlement negotiations, all three parties moved for summary judgment. ADAP maintained its legal entitlement to access all of SafetyNet Academy’s programs. Conversely, the defendants argued that individuals within the Moderate Program, possessing moderate rather than severe mental illness, were excluded from P&A protection. Shortly thereafter, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) submitted a statement of interest supporting ADAP's position that summary judgment against the defendants was appropriate, asserting SafetyNet Academy facilities fell squarely within PAIMI regulations, mandating reasonable unrestricted access to all academy programs.\n\nOn December 12, 2014, Judge Callie V.S. Grande awarded summary judgment to ADAP, denying both defendants’ requests for summary judgment, as well as SafetyNet’s request for indemnification and contribution against DHR. The court determined PAIMI, PADD, and PAIR applied to SafetyNet Academy, given its status as a facility providing residential treatment for individuals with mental illness and other disabilities. The judge rejected the defendants’ assertion that individuals with moderate mental illness could be excluded from P&A protection, emphasizing these laws’ protections were intended to be broad in scope and did not define P&A access “one resident at a time.” Accordingly, Judge Grande held ADAP was authorized to monitor all SafetyNet Academy programs and must be allowed reasonable access by law, awarding declaratory and permanent injunctive relief to the plaintiff. The order further directed ADAP and SafetyNet to prepare a protocol for ADAP’s monitoring and investigation visits. The court denied SafetyNet’s request for indemnification against DHR and initially held each party should bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs. 65 F.Supp.3d 1312.\n\nSubsequent to the court’s order, the parties submitted an access protocol describing ADAP’s scope of access and procedures for future access denials. Regarding fees, on February 11, 2015, Judge Grande awarded ADAP filing fees as the prevailing party but denied attorneys’ fees, citing ADAP’s failure to raise an applicable exception to the American Rule. 2015 WL 566946.",

The plaintiff, which served as Alabama’s designated protection and advocacy program for people with disabilities, sued SafetyNet Youthcare, Inc. (SafetyNet) under the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act of 1986 (PAIMI), the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (PADD Act), and the Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Program of 1993 (PAIR). The plaintiff alleged that SafetyNet had unlawfully failed to allow it, as Alabama’s Protection and Advocacy (P&A) provider, to monitor the defendant's facilities. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had failed to grant ADAP access to facilities used for SafetyNet Academy, a program operated by the defendant for male youths with emotional or behavioral disabilities. The plaintiff claimed that, despite several attempts to explain to the staff at SafetyNet Academy why they were required by law to allow ADAP into all of the Academy's facilities for monitoring and investigation purposes, the defendant repeatedly refused to grant ADAP access to what it referred to as its Moderate Program. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and a preliminary injunction to compel the SafetyNet Academy to grant them reasonable access to the facilities.</p><p>On December 2, 2013 – the same day the defendant filed an answer denying that it was required to allow the plaintiff access to its Moderate Program – it also filed a third-party complaint against the Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR). SafetyNet claimed that, because it had acted on the advice and counsel of DHR, which served as its licensing authority, any potential violations on its own part were caused by DHR. On this basis, it sought indemnification from DHR for any recovery that may be received by the plaintiff against SafetyNet. </p><p>Unable to agree on terms of a settlement, the parties proceeded with discovery. On September 19, 2014, all three parties moved for summary judgment. While the plaintiff held onto its position that it was allowed access to all of SafetyNet Academy’s programs, the defendants argued that because the individuals in the Moderate Program had moderate (rather than severe) mental illness, they were excluded from P&A protection. </p><p>Shortly afterward, on October 14, 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) submitted a statement of interest supporting the plaintiff’s position that summary judgment against the defendants was appropriate. The DOJ asserted that the defendant’s facilities at SafetyNet Academy fell squarely within the parameters of PAIMI regulations and, as such, the plaintiff must be granted reasonable unrestricted access to all of the academy’s programs. </p><p>On December 12, 2014, Judge Callie V.S.

The judge found that, as a facility that provided residential treatment for individuals with mental illness and other disabilities, PAIMI, PADD, and PAIR applied to SafetyNet Academy. Rejecting defendants’ assertion that individuals with moderate mental illness may be excluded from P&A protection, she emphasized that the protections offered by these laws were intended to be broad in scope and did not define P&A access “one resident at a time.” Accordingly, Judge Grande held that ADAP was authorized to monitor all SafetyNet Academy programs and must be allowed reasonable access by law and awarded declaratory and permanent injunctive relief to the plaintiff. She also ordered ADAP and SafetyNet to meet and prepare a protocol for ADAP’s monitoring and investigation visits. Finally, the order denied SafetyNet’s request for indemnification against DHR and held that each party should bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs. 65 F.Supp.3d 1312.</p><p>The parties met and submitted access protocol on January 30, 2015. In addition to describing ADAP’s scope of access to SafetyNet and its records, the protocol outlined procedures ADAP may follow should SafetyNet deny or delay access to its facilities in the future. </p><p>Also following the grant of summary judgment, ADAP submitted a motion for reconsideration of the court’s denial of attorneys’ fees and costs. On February 11, 2015, Judge Grande issued an order awarding the plaintiff filing fees as the prevailing party. However, the order denied the plaintiff attorneys’ fees, citing a failure to raise an applicable exception to the American Rule stating that litigants are generally expected to bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs. 2015 WL 566946.</p>",

ADAP alleged that SafetyNet illegally prevented it, as Alabama's P&A provider, from monitoring SafetyNet's facilities. Specifically, ADAP claimed SafetyNet did not allow access to its SafetyNet Academy facilities, a program for young men with emotional or behavioral disabilities. ADAP stated that despite repeated attempts to explain the legal requirement for access to all Academy facilities for monitoring and investigation, SafetyNet repeatedly denied access to its \"Moderate Program.\" ADAP asked the court to declare its right to access and issue a preliminary order (injunction) to force SafetyNet Academy to allow it reasonable access.\n\nOn December 2, 2013, the same day SafetyNet filed its response denying it had to allow ADAP access to its Moderate Program, it also sued the Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR). SafetyNet argued that DHR, its licensing authority, had advised it. Therefore, any wrongdoing by SafetyNet was DHR's fault. Based on this, SafetyNet asked DHR to cover any money ADAP might win against SafetyNet.\n\nThe parties could not agree on a settlement, so they moved forward with exchanging information (discovery). On September 19, 2014, all three parties asked the court for a judgment in their favor without a full trial (summary judgment). ADAP maintained its right to access all SafetyNet Academy programs. SafetyNet and DHR, however, argued that individuals in the Moderate Program had only moderate, not severe, mental illness, and therefore were not covered by P&A protections.\n\nSoon after, on October 14, 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a statement supporting ADAP. The DOJ agreed that the court should rule in ADAP's favor without a trial. The DOJ stated that SafetyNet Academy's facilities clearly fell under PAIMI rules. This meant ADAP must be given reasonable, unrestricted access to all of the academy's programs.\n\nOn December 12, 2014, Judge Callie V.S. Grande ruled in favor of ADAP, granting it summary judgment. She denied SafetyNet's and DHR's requests for summary judgment, and also denied SafetyNet's request for DHR to cover its costs. The judge determined that SafetyNet Academy, as a residential treatment facility for people with mental illness and other disabilities, was covered by PAIMI, PADD, and PAIR. She rejected the argument that individuals with moderate mental illness were excluded from P&A protection. She stressed that these laws were meant to offer broad protection and did not limit P&A access based on each individual resident. Therefore, Judge Grande ruled that ADAP had the authority to monitor all SafetyNet Academy programs and must be given reasonable access by law. She issued a declaration of rights and a permanent order (injunction) in ADAP's favor. She also ordered ADAP and SafetyNet to create a formal plan (protocol) for ADAP's monitoring and investigation visits. Finally, the order again denied SafetyNet's request for DHR to cover its costs. The judge also ruled that each party would pay their own legal fees and expenses.\n\nThe parties met and submitted the access plan on January 30, 2015. This plan detailed ADAP's access to SafetyNet's facilities and records. It also outlined steps ADAP could take if SafetyNet denied or delayed access in the future.\n\nAfter the summary judgment ruling, ADAP asked the court to reconsider its decision to deny legal fees and costs. On February 11, 2015, Judge Grande issued an order granting ADAP its filing fees, as it was the winning party. However, she denied ADAP's request for attorneys' fees. She noted that ADAP had not shown an exception to the \"American Rule,\" which generally requires each party to pay their own legal fees and costs.",

              "transformed_text": "On October 25, 2013, the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program (ADAP) sued SafetyNet Youthcare, Inc. (SafetyNet) in federal court. ADAP, Alabama’s official program for protecting and advocating for people with disabilities, claimed SafetyNet violated several federal laws designed to protect people with disabilities, including those with mental illness. These laws included the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act (PAIMI), the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (PADD Act), and the Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Program (PAIR).\n\nADAP claimed SafetyNet illegally stopped it from checking on SafetyNet's facilities. Specifically, ADAP said SafetyNet wouldn't let it into SafetyNet Academy, a program for young men with emotional or behavioral issues. ADAP stated that even after explaining its legal right to access all parts of the Academy for monitoring and investigations, SafetyNet repeatedly refused to let it into a specific part called the \"Moderate Program.\" ADAP asked the court to officially declare its right to access and to issue a temporary court order, called a preliminary injunction, to force SafetyNet Academy to allow it reasonable access.\n\nOn December 2, 2013, the same day SafetyNet filed its response saying it didn't have to let ADAP into its Moderate Program, it also sued the Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR). SafetyNet argued that DHR, which gives it its operating license, had given it advice. So, SafetyNet claimed any mistakes it made were DHR's fault. Because of this, SafetyNet asked DHR to pay for any damages or costs ADAP might win against SafetyNet; this is called seeking \"indemnification.\"\n\nThe parties couldn't agree to settle the case, so they moved ahead with exchanging information, a process called \"discovery.\" On September 19, 2014, all three parties asked the court to rule in their favor without a full trial, a request known as \"summary judgment.\" ADAP insisted it had the right to access all of SafetyNet Academy's programs. SafetyNet and DHR, however, argued that the people in the Moderate Program had only moderate, not severe, mental illness, and therefore weren't covered by the laws protecting people with disabilities.\n\nSoon after, on October 14, 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a statement supporting ADAP's side.

This meant ADAP must be given reasonable, unrestricted access to all of the academy's programs.\n\nOn December 12, 2014, Judge Callie V.S. Grande ruled in favor of ADAP, granting its request for summary judgment. She denied similar requests from SafetyNet and DHR, and also rejected SafetyNet's request for DHR to pay its costs. The judge decided that SafetyNet Academy, as a place that provides residential treatment for people with mental illness and other disabilities, was covered by the federal laws protecting people with disabilities (PAIMI, PADD, and PAIR). She rejected the argument that people with moderate mental illness were not covered by these protections. She emphasized that these laws were designed to offer wide-ranging protection and did not limit access based on each individual resident's specific condition.\n\nTherefore, Judge Grande ruled that ADAP had the legal power to monitor all SafetyNet Academy programs and must be given reasonable access, as required by law. She issued an official declaration of ADAP's rights and a permanent court order, known as a permanent injunction, in ADAP's favor. She also ordered ADAP and SafetyNet to create a formal plan, or \"protocol,\" for ADAP's monitoring and investigation visits. Finally, the order again denied SafetyNet's request for DHR to cover its costs.

              "transformed_text": "Imagine a group whose job it is to stick up for students with disabilities, making sure they get the support and rights they're supposed to have. That's kind of like the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program (ADAP). In 2013, ADAP took SafetyNet Youthcare, Inc. (SafetyNet) to court. ADAP claimed SafetyNet wasn't following federal laws that protect people with disabilities, especially those with mental health challenges. Think of these laws as a set of rules, like the 'Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act,' that make sure people with disabilities are treated fairly.\n\nADAP said SafetyNet was breaking the rules by not letting them visit and check on their facilities. Specifically, ADAP wanted to get into SafetyNet Academy, a place for young men dealing with emotional or behavioral issues. ADAP explained that the law gave them the right to visit all areas of the Academy to make sure everything was okay. But SafetyNet kept saying 'no,' especially when it came to a specific part called the 'Moderate Program.' So, ADAP asked the judge to officially say they had the right to go in, and to issue a special temporary order – like a principal telling a student they *have* to follow a rule *right now* – to force SafetyNet to let them in.\n\nOn the very day SafetyNet told the court it wouldn't let ADAP into the Moderate Program, SafetyNet also turned around and sued another group: the Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR). Think of DHR as the state agency that gives places like SafetyNet their 'okay to operate' license. SafetyNet argued that DHR had given them advice, and if SafetyNet did anything wrong, it was DHR's fault. So, SafetyNet basically said, 'If ADAP wins and we have to pay, DHR should be the one to pay for it!' This is like saying, 'If I get in trouble for something my teacher told me to do, my teacher should pay the consequences.'\n\nSince everyone couldn't agree to a peaceful solution, the case moved forward. They started 'discovery,' which is like each side gathering all the facts and evidence they can find. Then, in September 2014, all three groups asked the judge to make a decision without needing a full trial – this is called 'summary judgment.' ADAP stuck to its belief that it had the right to visit all parts of SafetyNet Academy. But SafetyNet and DHR argued that the young men in the Moderate Program only had 'moderate' mental health issues, not 'severe' ones, so they shouldn't be covered by the disability protection laws.\n\nNot long after, a big player stepped in: the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). Think of the DOJ as the federal government's main law enforcement arm. They filed a statement saying they agreed with ADAP and that the judge should rule in ADAP's favor without a trial. The DOJ said SafetyNet Academy clearly fell under the rules of the 'Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act,' meaning ADAP *had* to be allowed reasonable access to *all* of the academy's programs, no exceptions.\n\nOn December 12, 2014, Judge Callie V.S. Grande made her decision. She sided with ADAP, saying they were right and granting their request to win without a trial. She said 'no' to SafetyNet's and DHR's requests. She also rejected SafetyNet's idea that DHR should pay its bills. The judge explained that SafetyNet Academy, because it helps people with mental illness and other disabilities by providing a place for them to live and get treatment, *was* covered by those federal laws protecting people with disabilities. She didn't buy the argument that people with 'moderate' mental illness weren't protected. She stressed that these laws were meant to protect *everyone* broadly, not just those with the most severe conditions, and access shouldn't be limited based on what each person's specific situation was.\n\nSo, Judge Grande officially ruled that ADAP had the legal authority – like a green light from the law – to check on all of SafetyNet Academy's programs and *had* to be given reasonable access. She issued an official statement confirming ADAP's rights and a permanent court order – like a rule that stays in place forever – telling SafetyNet to comply. She also told ADAP and SafetyNet to work together to create a formal plan, or 'protocol,' for how ADAP's visits would happen. And once again, the judge said 'no' to SafetyNet's request for DHR to pay its costs. The judge also decided that, generally, each side would have to pay for their own lawyers and court expenses.\n\nThe two sides did meet and turned in their access plan in January 2015. This plan clearly explained how ADAP would get into SafetyNet's buildings and look at their records. It also laid out what ADAP could do if SafetyNet ever tried to block or slow down their access again.\n\nAfter winning the main part of the case, ADAP asked the court to reconsider its decision about legal fees. In February 2015, Judge Grande said ADAP could get back the money it paid to file the lawsuit, since they won. But she still said 'no' to ADAP's request for their lawyers' fees. She explained that ADAP hadn't shown a special reason to go against something called the 'American Rule,' which basically says that, most of the time, everyone involved in a lawsuit has to pay for their own lawyers and other legal costs, win or lose.",

              "transformed_text": "The Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program (ADAP) helps people with disabilities. They make sure these people get the support and rights they need. In 2013, ADAP sued a group called SafetyNet Youthcare, Inc. (SafetyNet). ADAP said SafetyNet was not following rules that protect people with disabilities. This was especially true for young people with mental health problems. These rules are like the \"Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act.\" They make sure people with disabilities are treated fairly.\n\nADAP said SafetyNet broke the rules. SafetyNet would not let ADAP visit their buildings. ADAP wanted to go inside SafetyNet Academy. This was a place for young men with emotional or behavior problems. ADAP said the law gave them the right to visit all parts of the Academy. They wanted to make sure everything was okay. But SafetyNet kept saying \"no.\" They especially said no to a part called the \"Moderate Program.\" So, ADAP asked the judge to say they had the right to go in. They also asked for a special order. This order would force SafetyNet to let them in right away.\n\nOn the same day, SafetyNet told the court it would not let ADAP into the Moderate Program. SafetyNet also sued another group. This group was the Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR). DHR is like the state group that gives places like SafetyNet permission to open. SafetyNet said DHR had given them advice. They said if they did anything wrong, it was DHR's fault. So, SafetyNet said, \"If ADAP wins and we have to pay, DHR should pay for it!\"\n\nThey could not agree on a solution. So, the case kept going. They started \"discovery.\" This means each side gathered facts and proof. Then, in September 2014, all three groups asked the judge for a quick decision. They did not want a full trial. This is called \"summary judgment.\" ADAP still believed it could visit all parts of SafetyNet Academy. But SafetyNet and DHR said the young men in the Moderate Program only had \"moderate\" mental health problems. They said these problems were not \"severe.\" So, they argued these young men should not be protected by the disability laws.\n\nSoon after, a big group joined in. It was the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). The DOJ is the main law group for the U.S. government. They filed a paper saying they agreed with ADAP. They said the judge should rule for ADAP without a trial. The DOJ said SafetyNet Academy clearly followed the rules of the \"Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act.\" This meant ADAP *had* to be allowed to visit *all* of the academy's programs. There were no exceptions.\n\nOn December 12, 2014, Judge Callie V.S. Grande made her choice. She sided with ADAP. She said they were right. She let them win without a trial. She said \"no\" to SafetyNet's and DHR's requests. She also said \"no\" to SafetyNet's idea that DHR should pay its costs. The judge said SafetyNet Academy helps people with mental illness and other disabilities. It gives them a place to live and get help. So, it *was* covered by those federal laws that protect people with disabilities. She did not agree that people with \"moderate\" mental illness were not protected. She said these laws were meant to protect *everyone*. Not just those with very bad problems. Access should not be limited based on what each person's specific situation was.\n\nSo, Judge Grande officially said ADAP had the legal right to check on all of SafetyNet Academy's programs. SafetyNet *had* to let them in. She made an official statement. It said ADAP's rights were real. She also made a permanent court order. This order told SafetyNet to follow the rules. She also told ADAP and SafetyNet to work together. They needed to make a plan for how ADAP's visits would happen. And again, the judge said \"no\" to SafetyNet's request for DHR to pay its costs. The judge also decided that each side would pay for its own lawyers and court costs.\n\nThe two sides met. They gave their access plan in January 2015. This plan showed how ADAP would get into SafetyNet's buildings. It also showed how they would look at records. It also said what ADAP could do if SafetyNet tried to stop them again.\n\nAfter winning the main part of the case, ADAP asked the court to think again about legal fees. In February 2015, Judge Grande said ADAP could get back the money it paid to start the lawsuit. This was because they won. But she still said \"no\" to ADAP's request for their lawyers' fees. She said ADAP had not shown a special reason to go against the \"American Rule.\" This rule means that usually, everyone in a lawsuit pays for their own lawyers and costs. It does not matter if they win or lose.",

              "text": "<p>On October 25, 2013, the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program (ADAP) filed this lawsuit in the District Court for the Southern District of Alabama. The plaintiff, which served as Alabama’s designated protection and advocacy program for people with disabilities, sued SafetyNet Youthcare, Inc. (SafetyNet) under the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act of 1986 (PAIMI), the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (PADD Act), and the Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Program of 1993 (PAIR). The plaintiff alleged that SafetyNet had unlawfully failed to allow it, as Alabama’s Protection and Advocacy (P&A) provider, to monitor the defendant's facilities. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had failed to grant ADAP access to facilities used for SafetyNet Academy, a program operated by the defendant for male youths with emotional or behavioral disabilities. The plaintiff claimed that, despite several attempts to explain to the staff at SafetyNet Academy why they were required by law to allow ADAP into all of the Academy's facilities for monitoring and investigation purposes, the defendant repeatedly refused to grant ADAP access to what it referred to as its Moderate Program. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and a preliminary injunction to compel the SafetyNet Academy to grant them reasonable access to the facilities.</p><p>On December 2, 2013 – the same day the defendant filed an answer denying that it was required to allow the plaintiff access to its Moderate Program – it also filed a third-party complaint against the Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR). SafetyNet claimed that, because it had acted on the advice and counsel of DHR, which served as its licensing authority, any potential violations on its own part were caused by DHR. On this basis, it sought indemnification from DHR for any recovery that may be received by the plaintiff against SafetyNet. </p><p>Unable to agree on terms of a settlement, the parties proceeded with discovery. On September 19, 2014, all three parties moved for summary judgment. While the plaintiff held onto its position that it was allowed access to all of SafetyNet Academy’s programs, the defendants argued that because the individuals in the Moderate Program had moderate (rather than severe) mental illness, they were excluded from P&A protection. </p><p>Shortly afterward, on October 14, 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) submitted a statement of interest supporting the plaintiff’s position that summary judgment against the defendants was appropriate. The DOJ asserted that the defendant’s facilities at SafetyNet Academy fell squarely within the parameters of PAIMI regulations and, as such, the plaintiff must be granted reasonable unrestricted access to all of the academy’s programs. </p><p>On December 12, 2014, Judge Callie V.S. Grande awarded summary judgment to the plaintiff, denying both defendants’ requests for summary judgment as well as SafetyNet’s request for indemnification and contribution against DHR. The judge found that, as a facility that provided residential treatment for individuals with mental illness and other disabilities, PAIMI, PADD, and PAIR applied to SafetyNet Academy. Rejecting defendants’ assertion that individuals with moderate mental illness may be excluded from P&A protection, she emphasized that the protections offered by these laws were intended to be broad in scope and did not define P&A access “one resident at a time.” Accordingly, Judge Grande held that ADAP was authorized to monitor all SafetyNet Academy programs and must be allowed reasonable access by law and awarded declaratory and permanent injunctive relief to the plaintiff. She also ordered ADAP and SafetyNet to meet and prepare a protocol for ADAP’s monitoring and investigation visits. Finally, the order denied SafetyNet’s request for indemnification against DHR and held that each party should bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs. 65 F.Supp.3d 1312.</p><p>The parties met and submitted access protocol on January 30, 2015. In addition to describing ADAP’s scope of access to SafetyNet and its records, the protocol outlined procedures ADAP may follow should SafetyNet deny or delay access to its facilities in the future. </p><p>Also following the grant of summary judgment, ADAP submitted a motion for reconsideration of the court’s denial of attorneys’ fees and costs. On February 11, 2015, Judge Grande issued an order awarding the plaintiff filing fees as the prevailing party. However, the order denied the plaintiff attorneys’ fees, citing a failure to raise an applicable exception to the American Rule stating that litigants are generally expected to bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs. 2015 WL 566946.</p>",

              "transformed_text": "The Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program (ADAP), serving as the state's designated advocate for people with disabilities, initiated legal action in October 2013. Their purpose was to compel SafetyNet Youthcare, Inc. (SafetyNet) to grant them access to its facilities, specifically SafetyNet Academy, a program for male youths with emotional or behavioral disabilities. ADAP believed that SafetyNet was unlawfully impeding its ability to monitor and investigate the facilities, a right granted by federal laws like PAIMI, PADD, and PAIR. Despite repeated attempts to explain their legal mandate, ADAP found SafetyNet unwilling to allow access to what it termed its \"Moderate Program,\" prompting ADAP to seek a court order to ensure reasonable access.\n\nSafetyNet, in response, not only denied ADAP's claims, asserting it was not required to permit access to its \"Moderate Program,\" but also strategically brought the Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR) into the case. SafetyNet argued that if any wrongdoing occurred, DHR, as its licensing authority, was responsible due to the advice it had provided, thereby seeking to shift potential financial responsibility.\n\nWhen efforts to reach a settlement proved futile, all parties sought a definitive court ruling without the need for a full trial by moving for summary judgment in September 2014. ADAP maintained its unwavering position that it possessed the right to monitor all of SafetyNet Academy's programs. Conversely, SafetyNet and DHR contended that individuals with \"moderate\" mental illness were outside the scope of the protection and advocacy laws, aiming to limit ADAP's reach.\n\nAdding significant weight to ADAP's argument, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) intervened in October 2014, submitting a statement that strongly supported ADAP's stance. The DOJ underscored that SafetyNet Academy's facilities clearly fell under federal regulations, necessitating unrestricted access for ADAP to all programs.\n\nUltimately, in December 2014, the court sided decisively with ADAP. The judge ruled that SafetyNet Academy, as a residential treatment facility for individuals with mental and other disabilities, was indeed subject to the comprehensive federal protection laws. The court rejected the defendants' narrow interpretation, emphasizing the broad intent of these laws to protect all individuals within such facilities, not just those with \"severe\" conditions. This judgment affirmed ADAP's authority to monitor all SafetyNet Academy programs, mandating reasonable access and ordering the parties to establish a clear protocol for future visits. The court also denied SafetyNet's attempt to transfer liability to DHR, requiring each party to bear its own legal costs.\n\nFollowing this ruling, ADAP and SafetyNet collaboratively developed and submitted an access protocol in January 2015. This agreement not only defined ADAP's scope of access to facilities and records but also established clear procedures for ADAP to follow if future access issues arose, ensuring the court's mandate was practically implemented.\n\nADAP later sought reconsideration regarding the denial of attorneys' fees, aiming to recover the costs incurred in pursuing this vital advocacy work. While the court awarded ADAP filing fees as the prevailing party in February 2015, it ultimately denied attorneys' fees, citing the general rule that litigants typically cover their own legal expenses unless specific exceptions apply.",

Plaintiff sought a declaration that the Act was unconstitutional on its face and as applied, a permanent injunction prohibiting its enforcement, and an award of attorney&rsquo;s fees and costs. Plaintiff subsequently moved for a preliminary injunction to enjoin enforcement of the Act during litigation.\n\nLitigation was subsequently stayed multiple times at the parties' joint request, primarily to facilitate scheduling discussions and allow the New York State Department of Health to advance its implementation efforts and define the scope and timing of information requests. During this period, the case was reassigned to Judge Jennifer H. Rearden.\n\nUltimately, the parties submitted and agreed to a Stipulation and Order of Settlement. The Court approved the dismissal of all Plaintiff's claims with prejudice, without payments, attorney's fees, costs, disbursements, or expenses, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a). Each party agreed to bear their own attorney's fees and costs. Defendant agreed not to take any enforcement action against Plaintiff for nonresponse or noncompliance with any survey, document, or information request authorized or issued under the statute. Per the agreement, the Court retained jurisdiction until the Defendant's authority to request data concluded with the report's publication. Judge Rearden directed the case be closed.",

The Sisters of Life run a crisis pregnancy center that helps pregnant women at their Visitation Mission in lower Manhattan. They claimed the Act created strict and difficult reporting rules, backed by fines. They argued these rules violated the First Amendment's Establishment Clause, and their First Amendment rights to free speech, free exercise of religion, assembly, and association. They also claimed it violated the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches. The Sisters of Life asked the Court to rule the Act unconstitutional, both generally and in how it applied to them. They also sought a permanent order to stop the Act from being enforced, along with their legal fees and costs.\n\nOn September 16, 2022, the Sisters of Life asked the court for a preliminary injunction. This was a temporary order to stop the Act from being enforced while the lawsuit was ongoing.\n\nOn October 7, 2022, both sides jointly asked to pause the lawsuit while they discussed how to move forward with the case. The Court agreed to pause the lawsuit until January 10, 2023. On January 18, 2023, this pause was extended until April 17, 2023, after both sides jointly asked for more time. The New York State Department of Health said it was still working on putting the law into effect and needed more time to figure out what information to ask for and when. Given this, both sides agreed that extending the pause was the most efficient way for them and for the Court to proceed.\n\nOn January 27, 2023, the case was assigned to a new judge, Jennifer H. Rearden. The pause in the case was extended several more times.\n\nOn November 3, 2023, both sides gave the court a proposed settlement agreement. On November 8, 2023, the settlement agreement was formally approved. Both sides agreed, and the Court approved, that all claims made by the Sisters of Life would be dismissed permanently. This meant they could not bring these claims again, and neither side would pay the other's legal fees or costs, as allowed by court rules (Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)). Each side agreed to pay their own legal fees and costs. The Department of Health agreed not to take any action against the Sisters of Life if they did not respond to or comply with any surveys or information requests allowed by the Act. Under the agreement, the court would keep authority over the case until the Department of Health's power to ask for data ended when the report was published. Judge Rearden then ordered the case closed.",

The Sisters of Life run a center in lower Manhattan called Visitation Mission, which helps pregnant women in crisis. They argued the law created strict and difficult reporting rules, with fines for not following them. They claimed these rules went against their First Amendment rights, which protect freedom of speech, religion, assembly (the right to gather), and association (the right to join groups). They also said it violated the \"Establishment Clause,\" which means the government cannot favor one religion over others. They also argued it violated the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unreasonable searches by the government. The Sisters of Life asked the court to declare the law unconstitutional, meaning it went against the U.S. Constitution, both in general and in how it specifically affected them. They also sought a permanent order, or \"injunction,\" to stop the law from being put into effect, and asked for their legal fees and costs to be paid.\n\nOn September 16, 2022, the Sisters of Life asked the court for a \"preliminary injunction.\" This is a temporary court order that would have stopped the law from being enforced while the lawsuit continued.\n\nOn October 7, 2022, both sides involved in the lawsuit jointly asked the court to \"pause\" the case, or put it on hold, while they talked about how to proceed. The court agreed to halt the lawsuit until January 10, 2023. On January 18, 2023, this pause was extended to April 17, 2023, after both sides again asked for more time. The New York State Department of Health said it was still working on putting the law into effect. It needed more time to figure out what information to ask for and when. Because of this, both sides agreed that extending the pause was the most efficient way for them and for the court to move forward.\n\nOn January 27, 2023, the case was assigned to a new judge, Jennifer H. Rearden. The pause in the case was extended several more times.\n\nOn November 3, 2023, both sides presented the court with a proposed agreement to settle the case. On November 8, 2023, the settlement was officially approved. Both sides agreed, and the court approved, that all claims made by the Sisters of Life would be permanently dropped. This meant the Sisters of Life could not bring these claims again in the future. Also, neither side would pay the other's legal fees or costs. Each side agreed to pay their own legal fees and costs. The Department of Health agreed not to take any action against the Sisters of Life if they chose not to respond to or follow any surveys or requests for information allowed by the law. Under the agreement, the court would keep authority over the case until the Department of Health's power to ask for data ended once the report was published. Judge Rearden then ordered the case closed.",

New York Governor Kathy Hochul described this law as a \"nation-leading package\" designed to protect abortion and reproductive rights. The law allowed the state's main health official to study and report on what pregnant women in New York needed for their health and resources that they weren't getting.\n\nOn September 2, 2022, the Sisters of Life, a Catholic group of nuns in New York City, sued the person in charge of the New York State Department of Health. The Sisters of Life run a place in lower Manhattan called Visitation Mission, which helps pregnant women who are going through tough times. They argued that the new law created strict and complicated rules for reporting information, and that they would face fines if they didn't follow them. They claimed these rules went against their First Amendment rights, which protect important freedoms like speech, religion, and the right to gather or join groups. They also said it violated the \"Establishment Clause,\" which is like a rule saying the government can't pick a favorite religion over others. On top of that, they argued it broke the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unfair searches by the government. The Sisters of Life asked the court to say the law was unconstitutional, meaning it went against the U.S. Constitution, both generally and in how it specifically hurt them. They also wanted a permanent court order, called an \"injunction,\" to stop the law from ever starting, and asked for their legal bills to be paid.\n\nOn September 16, 2022, the Sisters of Life asked the court for a \"preliminary injunction.\" Think of this like a temporary pause button for the law that would have stopped it from being enforced while the lawsuit was still going on.\n\nOn October 7, 2022, both sides involved in the lawsuit together asked the court to hit the \"pause\" button on the case, or put it on hold, so they could talk about how to move forward. The court agreed to halt the lawsuit until January 10, 2023. On January 18, 2023, this pause was extended again to April 17, 2023, after both sides asked for more time.

They claimed that the Act imposed intrusive and burdensome disclosure requirements, enforced by financial penalties, in violation of the First Amendment's Establishment Clause as well as the First Amendment rights to free speech, free exercise, assembly, and association in addition to the Fourth Amendment&rsquo;s protection against unreasonable search and seizure.

On September 2, 2022, they initiated a lawsuit against the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health. Their core concern was that the Act's mandated disclosure requirements, enforced by financial penalties, would intrude upon their operations and violate their fundamental First Amendment rights, including free speech, free exercise of religion, assembly, and association, as well as the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable search and seizure. The Sisters of Life sought to nullify the Act, asking the Court to declare it unconstitutional and permanently prevent its enforcement.\n\nTo immediately protect themselves from the Act's provisions while the legal battle unfolded, the Sisters of Life swiftly filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on September 16, 2022. This strategic move aimed to halt enforcement of the Act during the litigation.\n\nAs the case progressed, both parties recognized the benefit of a pause. On October 7, 2022, they jointly requested a stay of the litigation. This strategic decision was driven by the New York State Department of Health's need for more time to clarify the Act's implementation, particularly the scope and timing of its information requests. By agreeing to multiple extensions of this stay, the parties sought an efficient path forward, allowing the state to refine its approach and potentially avoid further contentious litigation.\n\nUltimately, the parties reached a resolution outside of a full trial. On November 3, 2023, they submitted a proposed settlement, which the Court approved on November 8, 2023. This agreement represented a pragmatic outcome for both sides. The Sisters of Life achieved their primary objective: the state committed not to enforce any survey, document, or information requests authorized by the Act against them. In return, the Sisters agreed to dismiss all their claims, with each party bearing their own legal costs. The Court retained jurisdiction until the state's authority to request data under the Act concluded with the report's publication, marking the close of this particular chapter in the legal history of reproductive rights legislation in New York.",

After the Sisters of Life initiated their challenge against the Act's mandated disclosure requirements, the parties engaged in a period of negotiation and pauses in their dispute, ultimately reaching an agreement.\n\nThe resolution, approved by the court, provided a pragmatic outcome for both sides. The state committed not to enforce any survey, document, or information requests authorized by the Act specifically against the Sisters of Life. In return, the Sisters agreed to drop their challenge, with each party bearing their own legal expenses. This agreement effectively addressed the Sisters' primary concern regarding the Act's potential intrusion, allowing the state to continue its study without further contention from this specific organization. The court maintained oversight until the state's authority to request data under the Act concluded with the report's publication.",

They entered into conversations with state officials, hoping to find a path forward that respected everyone's needs.\n\nAfter careful discussions, a peaceful solution emerged. The state agreed that the sisters would not be asked to provide any of their confidential details for the study. This meant the sisters could continue their vital work, offering support and care without compromise, while the state could still gather important insights into women's health across the region.

        "summary": "<p>On December 6, 2022, Disability Rights North Carolina (DRNC), the NAACP, and Children's Rights filed suit on behalf of a class of North Carolina youth in foster care with mental and behavioral health. The plaintiffs filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina against the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The case was assigned to Judge William L. Osteen, Jr. and Magistrate Judge L. Patrick Auld.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs asserted that the defendants&rsquo; actions violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. In particular, the plaintiffs alleged that DHHS was discriminating against children with disabilities in child welfare custody by unnecessarily segregating them from their home communities and placing them in heavily restrictive, and often clinically inappropriate, psychiatric residential treatment facilities (PRTFs). The plaintiffs requested class-wide relief and asked the Court to certify the putative class and award permanent injunctive relief. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought class certification for those meeting the following criteria: (a) children who are or will be in North Carolina foster care, who are or will be in the custody of a North Carolina county department of social services; (b) with a mental impairment that substantially limits at least one major life activity, or a record of such an impairment; (c) who are unnecessarily institutionalized in a PRTF or who are at serious risk of such institutionalization.</p>\r\n<p>On March 6, 2023, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, removing one of the named plaintiffs. Later that month, on March 20, the defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim and lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\r\n<p>The United States filed a statement of interest in support of the plaintiffs' claims on April 21, 2023. The US argued that 1) the plaintiffs did not need opinions from state treatment professionals in order to establish that integrated settings were appropriate; 2) the children in state custody did not need to allege that their custodians chose community-based care; 3) pending state court proceedings about whether children should be placed in PRTFs did not prevent the plaintiffs from bringing these claims of unnecessary segregation; and 4) the plaintiffs had standing to bring claims against DHHS.</p>\r\n<p>Almost a year later, on March 29, 2024, Judge Osteen denied the defendants' motion to dismiss. 2024 WL 1350071. The Court held that the Plaintiffs had established standing and that their allegations met the requirements of <em><a href=\"../../../../case/11643/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">L.C. v. Olmstead</a></em>. Under <em>Olmstead</em>, community placement is required when: (1) community placement is appropriate; (2) &ldquo;the transfer from institutional care to a less restrictive setting is not opposed by the affected individual;&rdquo; and (3) &ldquo;the placement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs of others with mental disabilities.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The Court found that on the facts alleged, though some of the plaintiffs were frequently institutionalized, it was because of a lack of community-based alternatives, not because they required institutionalization, so the plaintiffs had still sufficiently alleged community placement was appropriate. Some plaintiffs were not in institutions but were allegedly at serious risk of being institutionalized, which is also covered by <em>Olmstead.</em> Second, the Court held that <em>Olmstead </em>did not require a minor to allege that their custodian requested community placement: the plaintiffs alleged that they desired community-based services, meeting the second <em>Olmstead </em>prong. Third, the Court held that plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that their placement in the community could be reasonably accommodated, stating that any inquiry into the effectiveness of the state&rsquo;s plan for community-based services was not necessary at the motion to dismiss stage. Finally, the court held that the Plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were not barred by issue preclusion based on state court hearings because the state court hearings were based on individual placements and not the systemic failures alleged here.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing as of April 26, 2024.&nbsp;</p>",

Finally, the court held that the Plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were not barred by issue preclusion based on state court hearings because the state court hearings were based on individual placements and not the systemic failures alleged here.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing as of April 26, 2024.&nbsp;</p>",

The case was assigned to Judge William L. Osteen, Jr. and Magistrate Judge L. Patrick Auld.\n\nThe plaintiffs asserted that the defendants&rsquo; actions violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Specifically, plaintiffs alleged DHHS discriminated against children with disabilities in child welfare custody by unnecessarily segregating them from their home communities and placing them in heavily restrictive, and often clinically inappropriate, psychiatric residential treatment facilities (PRTFs). The plaintiffs requested class-wide relief, seeking certification of the putative class and permanent injunctive relief.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought class certification for those meeting the following criteria: (a) children who are or will be in North Carolina foster care, who are or will be in the custody of a North Carolina county department of social services; (b) with a mental impairment that substantially limits at least one major life activity, or a record of such an impairment; (c) who are unnecessarily institutionalized in a PRTF or who are at serious risk of such institutionalization.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, removing one named plaintiff. Subsequently, the defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim and lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nThe United States filed a statement of interest in support of the plaintiffs' claims, arguing that: 1) plaintiffs did not need opinions from state treatment professionals to establish appropriate integrated settings; 2) children in state custody did not need to allege their custodians chose community-based care; 3) pending state court proceedings regarding PRTF placements did not preclude these claims of unnecessary segregation; and 4) plaintiffs had standing to sue DHHS.\n\nOn March 29, 2024, Judge Osteen denied the defendants' motion to dismiss (2024 WL 1350071), holding that Plaintiffs established standing and their allegations met the requirements of *L.C. v. Olmstead*. Under *Olmstead*, community placement is mandated when: (1) it is appropriate; (2) the affected individual does not oppose transfer from institutional care to a less restrictive setting; and (3) the placement can be reasonably accommodated, considering state resources and the needs of other individuals with mental disabilities.\n\nThe Court found that plaintiffs sufficiently alleged community placement was appropriate, noting that frequent institutionalization of some plaintiffs stemmed from a lack of community-based alternatives, not a requirement for institutionalization. Further, *Olmstead* also covers plaintiffs at serious risk of institutionalization. Second, the Court held *Olmstead* did not require a minor to allege custodian-requested community placement, as plaintiffs' alleged desire for community-based services satisfied the second *Olmstead* prong. Third, the Court found plaintiffs sufficiently alleged reasonable accommodation for community placement, deeming inquiry into the state's plan effectiveness unnecessary at the motion to dismiss stage. Finally, the Court held plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were not issue-precluded by state court hearings, as those hearings addressed individual placements, not the systemic failures alleged in this action.\n\nThis case is ongoing as of April 26, 2024.",

The US argued that 1) the plaintiffs did not need opinions from state treatment professionals in order to establish that integrated settings were appropriate; 2) the children in state custody did not need to allege that their custodians chose community-based care; 3) pending state court proceedings about whether children should be placed in PRTFs did not prevent the plaintiffs from bringing these claims of unnecessary segregation; and 4) the plaintiffs had standing to bring claims against DHHS.</p>\r\n<p>Almost a year later, on March 29, 2024, Judge Osteen denied the defendants' motion to dismiss. 2024 WL 1350071. The Court held that the Plaintiffs had established standing and that their allegations met the requirements of <em><a href=\"../../../../case/11643/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">L.C. v. Olmstead</a></em>. Under <em>Olmstead</em>, community placement is required when: (1) community placement is appropriate; (2) &ldquo;the transfer from institutional care to a less restrictive setting is not opposed by the affected individual;&rdquo; and (3) &ldquo;the placement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs of others with mental disabilities.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The Court found that on the facts alleged, though some of the plaintiffs were frequently institutionalized, it was because of a lack of community-based alternatives, not because they required institutionalization, so the plaintiffs had still sufficiently alleged community placement was appropriate. Some plaintiffs were not in institutions but were allegedly at serious risk of being institutionalized, which is also covered by <em>Olmstead.</em> Second, the Court held that <em>Olmstead </em>did not require a minor to allege that their custodian requested community placement: the plaintiffs alleged that they desired community-based services, meeting the second <em>Olmstead </em>prong. Third, the Court held that plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that their placement in the community could be reasonably accommodated, stating that any inquiry into the effectiveness of the state&rsquo;s plan for community-based services was not necessary at the motion to dismiss stage. Finally, the court held that the Plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were not barred by issue preclusion based on state court hearings because the state court hearings were based on individual placements and not the systemic failures alleged here.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing as of April 26, 2024.&nbsp;</p>",

The plaintiffs filed their case in the federal court in North Carolina against the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The case was assigned to Judge William L. Osteen, Jr. and Magistrate Judge L. Patrick Auld.\n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that DHHS's actions broke the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Specifically, they alleged that DHHS was discriminating against children with disabilities in foster care. They said DHHS was wrongly separating these children from their home communities and placing them in very strict, and often unsuitable, psychiatric residential treatment facilities (PRTFs). The plaintiffs asked the court to grant relief for the entire group. They also requested the court officially recognize the group as a class and issue a permanent order to stop the alleged discrimination.\n\nThe plaintiffs wanted the court to approve the class for children who met these conditions: (a) children currently or soon to be in North Carolina foster care, under the care of a North Carolina county social services department; (b) who have a mental condition that significantly limits a major life activity, or a history of such a condition; and (c) who are wrongly placed in a PRTF or are at high risk of being placed there.\n\nOn March 6, 2023, the plaintiffs updated their complaint, removing one of the original plaintiffs. Later that month, on March 20, the defendants asked the court to dismiss the case. They argued the plaintiffs' claims were not legally sound and the court lacked the authority to hear the case.\n\nThe United States government filed a statement supporting the plaintiffs' arguments on April 21, 2023. The US argued that 1) plaintiffs did not need opinions from state treatment experts to show that community settings were suitable; 2) children in state care did not need to claim their guardians chose community-based care; 3) ongoing state court cases about placing children in PRTFs did not stop plaintiffs from arguing they were being wrongly separated; and 4) plaintiffs had the right to sue DHHS.\n\nAlmost a year later, on March 29, 2024, Judge Osteen rejected the defendants' request to dismiss the case. The Court ruled that the plaintiffs had the right to sue. It also found their claims met the standards set by the *Olmstead* Supreme Court case. Under *Olmstead*, placing individuals in community settings is required if: (1) a community placement is suitable; (2) the person does not object to moving from an institution to a less restrictive setting; and (3) the state can reasonably provide the community placement, considering its resources and the needs of other people with mental disabilities.\n\nThe Court found that based on the facts presented, some plaintiffs were often in institutions not because they needed to be, but because there were no suitable community options. This meant the plaintiffs had still adequately claimed that community placement was appropriate for them. Some plaintiffs were not in institutions but were reportedly at high risk of being placed there, which *Olmstead* also covers. Second, the Court ruled that *Olmstead* did not require a minor to claim their guardian asked for community placement. The plaintiffs stated they wanted community-based services, which met the second *Olmstead* condition. Third, the Court found that plaintiffs had sufficiently claimed that their community placement could be reasonably managed. It added that checking the state's plan for community services was not necessary at this early stage of the case. Finally, the court decided that the plaintiffs' claims were not blocked by previous state court decisions.

They wanted to help young people in North Carolina foster care. These kids needed help with their minds and behavior. The groups sued a state agency. It was called the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). They filed the case in a federal court in North Carolina. Two judges were given the case. Their names were Judge William L. Osteen, Jr. and Judge L. Patrick Auld.\n\nThe groups said DHHS was breaking two important laws. These were the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act. They claimed DHHS was treating kids with disabilities in foster care badly. They said DHHS was taking these kids away from their homes. DHHS was putting them in special hospitals called PRTFs. These places were very strict and often not good for the kids. The groups asked the court to help all the kids like this. They wanted the court to say these kids were a \"class.\" This means they were a large group with the same problem. They also asked the court to make a lasting rule to stop the unfair treatment.\n\nThe groups wanted the court to include kids who fit these rules: (a) Kids who were in North Carolina foster care, or would be soon. They had to be cared for by a North Carolina county social services department. (b) Kids with a mental problem that made it hard to do important things. Or kids who had such a problem before. (c) Kids who were wrongly put in a PRTF. Or kids who were very likely to be put in one.\n\nOn March 6, 2023, the groups changed their lawsuit. They took out one of the people who first sued. Later that month, on March 20, DHHS asked the court to stop the case. They said the groups' claims were not right by law. They also said the court could not hear the case.\n\nThe United States government stepped in. On April 21, 2023, it said it agreed with the groups. The U.S. said: 1) The groups didn't need experts to say community settings were good places for kids. 2) Kids in state care didn't need their guardians to say they wanted community care. 3) Other court cases about putting kids in PRTFs did not stop this lawsuit. The lawsuit was about kids being wrongly separated. 4) The groups had the right to sue DHHS.\n\nAlmost a year later, on March 29, 2024, Judge Osteen said no to DHHS. He would not stop the case. The court said the groups had the right to sue. It also said their claims followed rules from a big Supreme Court case. This case was called *Olmstead*. The *Olmstead* rule says people with disabilities should live in regular communities. They should not live in special places like hospitals. This is true if: (1) A community setting is good for them. (2) The person agrees to move to a less strict place. (3) The state can give them this care without too much trouble. This means thinking about money, staff, and other people who need help.\n\nThe court looked at the facts. It found some kids were in special places often. But it wasn't because they needed to be there. It was because there were no good places for them in the community. This showed the groups had enough proof. They showed that community living was right for these kids. Some kids were not in special places yet. But they were very likely to be put there. The *Olmstead* rule also covers these kids. Second, the court said *Olmstead* didn't need a child to say their parent or guardian asked for community living. The groups said the kids wanted help in their communities. This met the second *Olmstead* rule. Third, the court found the groups showed enough proof. They showed that community living for these kids could be managed. The court also said it was too early to check the state's plan for community help. Finally, the court said other state court decisions did not stop the groups' claims. This was because those other cases were about one child at a time. This lawsuit was about big problems affecting many kids.\n\nThis case is still happening as of April 26, 2024.",

The plaintiffs filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina against the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The case was assigned to Judge William L. Osteen, Jr. and Magistrate Judge L. Patrick Auld.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs asserted that the defendants&rsquo; actions violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. In particular, the plaintiffs alleged that DHHS was discriminating against children with disabilities in child welfare custody by unnecessarily segregating them from their home communities and placing them in heavily restrictive, and often clinically inappropriate, psychiatric residential treatment facilities (PRTFs). The plaintiffs requested class-wide relief and asked the Court to certify the putative class and award permanent injunctive relief. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought class certification for those meeting the following criteria: (a) children who are or will be in North Carolina foster care, who are or will be in the custody of a North Carolina county department of social services; (b) with a mental impairment that substantially limits at least one major life activity, or a record of such an impairment; (c) who are unnecessarily institutionalized in a PRTF or who are at serious risk of such institutionalization.</p>\r\n<p>On March 6, 2023, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, removing one of the named plaintiffs. Later that month, on March 20, the defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim and lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\r\n<p>The United States filed a statement of interest in support of the plaintiffs' claims on April 21, 2023. The US argued that 1) the plaintiffs did not need opinions from state treatment professionals in order to establish that integrated settings were appropriate; 2) the children in state custody did not need to allege that their custodians chose community-based care; 3) pending state court proceedings about whether children should be placed in PRTFs did not prevent the plaintiffs from bringing these claims of unnecessary segregation; and 4) the plaintiffs had standing to bring claims against DHHS.</p>\r\n<p>Almost a year later, on March 29, 2024, Judge Osteen denied the defendants' motion to dismiss. 2024 WL 1350071. The Court held that the Plaintiffs had established standing and that their allegations met the requirements of <em><a href=\"../../../../case/11643/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">L.C. v. Olmstead</a></em>. Under <em>Olmstead</em>, community placement is required when: (1) community placement is appropriate; (2) &ldquo;the transfer from institutional care to a less restrictive setting is not opposed by the affected individual;&rdquo; and (3) &ldquo;the placement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs of others with mental disabilities.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The Court found that on the facts alleged, though some of the plaintiffs were frequently institutionalized, it was because of a lack of community-based alternatives, not because they required institutionalization, so the plaintiffs had still sufficiently alleged community placement was appropriate. Some plaintiffs were not in institutions but were allegedly at serious risk of being institutionalized, which is also covered by <em>Olmstead.</em> Second, the Court held that <em>Olmstead </em>did not require a minor to allege that their custodian requested community placement: the plaintiffs alleged that they desired community-based services, meeting the second <em>Olmstead </em>prong. Third, the Court held that plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that their placement in the community could be reasonably accommodated, stating that any inquiry into the effectiveness of the state&rsquo;s plan for community-based services was not necessary at the motion to dismiss stage. Finally, the court held that the Plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were not barred by issue preclusion based on state court hearings because the state court hearings were based on individual placements and not the systemic failures alleged here.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing as of April 26, 2024.&nbsp;</p>",

              "transformed_text": "In a significant legal challenge to North Carolina's child welfare system, Disability Rights North Carolina (DRNC), the NAACP, and Children's Rights initiated a lawsuit on December 6, 2022. Their purpose was to advocate for a class of North Carolina youth in foster care who live with mental and behavioral health conditions. They brought their case in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, before Judge William L. Osteen, Jr. and Magistrate Judge L. Patrick Auld, against the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).\n\nThe heart of their complaint was the assertion that DHHS was violating the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The plaintiffs contended that the state was discriminating against children with disabilities in its care by unnecessarily isolating them from their home communities, placing them instead in highly restrictive and often clinically unsuitable psychiatric residential treatment facilities (PRTFs). Their strategic aim was to secure class-wide relief, including a court order to stop these practices, ensuring these children could access community-based care. The proposed class included children in North Carolina foster care with mental impairments who were either unnecessarily institutionalized or at serious risk of such placement.\n\nA minor refinement to their case occurred on March 6, 2023, when an amended complaint was filed, adjusting the named plaintiffs. Shortly thereafter, on March 20, the defendants, DHHS, sought to halt the proceedings entirely. Their motion to dismiss was a strategic maneuver to argue that the plaintiffs' claims lacked legal merit or that the court did not possess the authority to hear the case, thereby attempting to avoid further litigation.\n\nThe United States government, signaling its support for the plaintiffs' interpretation of federal disability law, filed a statement of interest on April 21, 2023. This intervention aimed to bolster the plaintiffs' position against the dismissal, asserting that their claims were valid and that the children had standing to sue DHHS.\n\nAlmost a year later, on March 29, 2024, Judge Osteen delivered a pivotal decision, denying the defendants' motion to dismiss. This ruling was a significant victory for the plaintiffs, confirming that they had established standing to bring their claims and that their allegations met the stringent requirements set forth by the Supreme Court in *L.C. v. Olmstead*. Under *Olmstead*, the law requires community placement when: (1) it is appropriate for the individual; (2) the individual does not oppose the move from institutional care to a less restrictive setting; and (3) the placement can be reasonably accommodated, considering the State's resources and the needs of others with mental disabilities.\n\nThe Court specifically found that despite some plaintiffs' frequent institutionalization, this was due to a scarcity of community-based alternatives, not a genuine need for institutionalization, thus sufficiently alleging community placement was appropriate. Furthermore, the Court clarified that *Olmstead* did not demand that a minor's custodian request community placement, as the plaintiffs' own desire for such services fulfilled the second prong. Crucially, the Court determined that the plaintiffs had adequately alleged that their community placement could be reasonably accommodated, emphasizing that an inquiry into the state's broader plan for community-based services was not necessary at this early stage. Lastly, the court rejected the argument that state court hearings on individual placements barred this systemic challenge, distinguishing between individual circumstances and broader systemic failures.\n\nAs of April 26, 2024, this case continues, poised to address the systemic issues raised by the plaintiffs.",

The court found strong evidence that many children were placed in institutions not because they needed that level of care, but because North Carolina failed to offer suitable community alternatives. Crucially, the court clarified that a child's own wish for community services is enough, regardless of what their guardians might request. It also recognized that providing community placement is feasible, dismissing arguments that a detailed state plan was needed to prove this point at this stage. Furthermore, the court made it clear that individual placement decisions in state courts do not prevent a broader challenge to systemic failures.

Many of these vulnerable children didn't truly need such restrictive environments; they were there because the state simply didn't offer suitable community-based options. They found themselves stuck, often away from the kind of support that could truly help them thrive.\n\nSeeing this difficult situation, advocacy groups like Disability Rights North Carolina, the NAACP, and Children's Rights stepped forward. They spoke up for these children, arguing that the state's practice was unfair and violated their fundamental rights. The state initially tried to halt these efforts, but the children's champions pushed back.\n\nIn a significant moment, the children's voices were heard. A decision ensured that their pleas for a different life would be fully considered. This meant a fundamental truth was upheld: states have a responsibility to offer care within the community for people with disabilities, especially when it's right for them and they desire it. It was recognized that providing community care was indeed possible, and crucially, that a child's own wish for this type of support was paramount, even if others disagreed. And importantly, the decision affirmed that the bigger picture of how the state cared for all these children could still be addressed, beyond individual situations. This marks a vital step towards ensuring North Carolina's most vulnerable foster children receive the integrated, community-based care they truly deserve.",

Rader Center (\"Rader\") juvenile detention facility. The complaint, as amended on May 4, 2007, alleged that the defendants (1) denied Rader's residents their rights to protection from harm from staff, from other residents, and from improper administration of psychotropic drugs; (2) provided inadequate mental health care at Rader, particularly as to screening, assessment, treatment and transition planning, and psychiatric and psychological services; and (3) failed to provide required special education services to qualifying Rader residents. Represented by Department of Justice Civil Rights Division attorneys, the federal government initiated the action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &sect; 14141, the pattern or practice provision of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The amended complaint alleged that the state defendants' conduct violated the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. &sect; 794, and related regulations, and the Individuals with Disabilities Act, 20 U.S.C. &sect; 1401.</p>\r\n<p>The case, assigned to District Judge Gregory K. Frizzell, prompted motion and discovery practice resulting in several June 2007, unpublished orders by Magistrate Judge Frank H. McCarthy. These addressed matters such as protective orders to keep disclosed information about residents confidential; scheduling of on-site inspections at Rader by the plaintiff's counsel and expert consultants; who would bear the cost of security escorts during the visits (the United States, said the magistrate); and whether interviews conducted during the visits would have to be recorded (they would).</p>\r\n<p>In June 2008, a settlement was reached and on September 9, 2008, the court (Judge Frizzell) entered an order incorporating the consent decree. The consent decree included resolutions about protecting juvenile residents from harm, prevention of suicide and self-harm, mental health care, and special education claims, and was set to expire three years from the date it was signed.</p>\r\n<p>In September 2011, a little over a week before the consent decree was set to expire, the U.S. filed an emergency motion to modify the decree. The U.S. alleged that since Rader was closed by the state in 2011, there had been several incidents at two \"replacement\" facilities. The U.S. alleged that the defendants had not given them full access to investigate the incidents. The U.S. wanted the consent decree modified to extend to these other facilities so that the incidents could be investigated with the support of the court. The defendants objected, arguing that Rader was the only facility under the order and that the two facilities were not replacements as defined in the consent decree. The court agreed with the defendants, finding that the separate, pre-existing juvenile centers were not replacements under the terms of the consent decree. The defendants then moved to dismiss the case, citing the expiration of the consent decree, which the court granted on November 18, 2011.The case was dismissed with prejudice.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is now closed.</p>",

Rader juvenile detention facility ultimately concluded with the court denying the U.S.'s attempt to extend a consent decree to other facilities and subsequently dismissing the case with prejudice upon the decree's expiration.\n\n*   In December 2006, the United States initiated litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the state of Oklahoma and officials operating the L.E. Rader Center. The amended complaint alleged defendants denied residents rights to protection from harm, provided inadequate mental health care, and failed to provide required special education services. This action was brought under 42 U.S.C. § 14141, the Fourteenth Amendment, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Individuals with Disabilities Act.\n*   A settlement was reached, leading to the court's entry of a consent decree on September 9, 2008. This decree resolved claims concerning protection from harm, suicide and self-harm prevention, mental health care, and special education for juvenile residents, and was set to expire three years from its signing date.\n*   Shortly before the decree's expiration in September 2011, the U.S. filed an emergency motion to modify, asserting incidents at \"replacement\" facilities post-Rader's closure and denied investigative access. The U.S. sought to extend the decree's applicability. Defendants objected, arguing Rader was the sole facility covered and the others were not \"replacements\" as defined.\n*   The court concurred with defendants, finding the pre-existing juvenile centers were not \"replacements\" under the consent decree's terms. Subsequently, defendants successfully moved to dismiss the case, citing the decree's expiration, which the court granted on November 18, 2011, dismissing the case with prejudice.",

Rader Center (\"Rader\") juvenile detention facility. The complaint, as amended on May 4, 2007, alleged that the defendants (1) denied Rader's residents their rights to protection from harm from staff, from other residents, and from improper administration of psychotropic drugs; (2) provided inadequate mental health care at Rader, particularly as to screening, assessment, treatment and transition planning, and psychiatric and psychological services; and (3) failed to provide required special education services to qualifying Rader residents. Represented by Department of Justice Civil Rights Division attorneys, the federal government initiated the action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &sect; 14141, the pattern or practice provision of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The amended complaint alleged that the state defendants' conduct violated the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. &sect; 794, and related regulations, and the Individuals with Disabilities Act, 20 U.S.C. &sect; 1401.</p>\r\n<p>The case, assigned to District Judge Gregory K. Frizzell, prompted motion and discovery practice resulting in several June 2007, unpublished orders by Magistrate Judge Frank H. McCarthy. These addressed matters such as protective orders to keep disclosed information about residents confidential; scheduling of on-site inspections at Rader by the plaintiff's counsel and expert consultants; who would bear the cost of security escorts during the visits (the United States, said the magistrate); and whether interviews conducted during the visits would have to be recorded (they would).</p>\r\n<p>In June 2008, a settlement was reached and on September 9, 2008, the court (Judge Frizzell) entered an order incorporating the consent decree. The consent decree included resolutions about protecting juvenile residents from harm, prevention of suicide and self-harm, mental health care, and special education claims, and was set to expire three years from the date it was signed.</p>\r\n<p>In September 2011, a little over a week before the consent decree was set to expire, the U.S. filed an emergency motion to modify the decree. The U.S. alleged that since Rader was closed by the state in 2011, there had been several incidents at two \"replacement\" facilities. The U.S. alleged that the defendants had not given them full access to investigate the incidents. The U.S. wanted the consent decree modified to extend to these other facilities so that the incidents could be investigated with the support of the court. The defendants objected, arguing that Rader was the only facility under the order and that the two facilities were not replacements as defined in the consent decree. The court agreed with the defendants, finding that the separate, pre-existing juvenile centers were not replacements under the terms of the consent decree. The defendants then moved to dismiss the case, citing the expiration of the consent decree, which the court granted on November 18, 2011.The case was dismissed with prejudice.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is now closed.</p>",

              "transformed_text": "Imagine a situation where the U.S. government (like a big brother looking out for everyone) sued the state of Oklahoma in 2006. They sued the people in charge of a place called the L.E. Rader Center, which was a special facility for young people who had gotten into trouble. This lawsuit, updated a few months later, basically asked the court to say, \"Hey, what Oklahoma is doing here is wrong,\" and then to make them fix it.\n\nThe U.S. government argued that the state officials weren't keeping the young people at Rader safe. This included not protecting them from harm by the staff, from other kids, and from being given the wrong powerful medications for their minds. They also said the mental health care was really bad. Things like not properly checking kids when they arrived, not figuring out what help they needed, not treating them well, and not planning for their lives after leaving Rader. And that kids with special learning needs weren't getting the special education they were legally supposed to receive. Lawyers from the Department of Justice, which is like the government's legal team, brought this case. They used a federal law designed to stop ongoing patterns of civil rights violations – basically, when someone's basic rights are repeatedly ignored. The lawsuit also said the state broke several important laws: the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution (which is all about making sure everyone is treated fairly and has proper legal steps taken), and two other federal laws, the Rehabilitation Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Act, which are designed to protect people with disabilities.\n\nJudge Gregory K. Frizzell was the judge in charge of this case. While the case was going on, both sides (the U.S. government and Oklahoma officials) made different requests to the court and shared information. This led to a few official orders from another judge, Magistrate Judge Frank H. McCarthy, in June 2007. These orders were about things like: keeping private details about the young people at Rader secret; letting the U.S. government's lawyers and their experts visit Rader to check things out; deciding that the U.S. would pay for security guards during these visits; and making sure that any interviews done during the visits were recorded.\n\nAbout a year later, in June 2008, both sides worked out an agreement, sort of like a compromise. On September 9, 2008, Judge Frizzell officially approved this agreement, making it a \"consent decree.\" Think of a consent decree as a special court order that makes an agreement between two sides legally binding and enforceable. It's like the judge stamping it \"official\" and saying, \"You *have* to follow this.\" This agreement laid out clear steps to keep the young people at Rader safe, prevent them from hurting themselves, improve their mental health care, and make sure they got the special education they needed. This special agreement was set to last for three years.\n\nFast forward to September 2011, just a little over a week before that three-year agreement was supposed to end, the U.S. government made an urgent request to change it. The U.S. said that Rader had actually closed down in 2011. And since then, they claimed there were new problems at two *other* facilities that they saw as basically replacing Rader. The U.S. argued that the state wasn't letting them fully investigate these new issues. So, the U.S. wanted the court's original agreement to now apply to these new places, so the court could help them investigate what was going on. But the state officials pushed back. They said, \"No way, that agreement was *only* for Rader. These other two places aren't 'replacements' according to what we agreed to.\" The court agreed with the state, deciding that the agreement didn't cover these other facilities. Then, the state asked the court to simply close the whole case, since the three-year agreement had now officially ended. The court agreed and officially closed the case for good on November 18, 2011.\n\nSo, this particular legal battle is now over.",

Rader Center (\"Rader\") juvenile detention facility. The complaint, as amended on May 4, 2007, alleged that the defendants (1) denied Rader's residents their rights to protection from harm from staff, from other residents, and from improper administration of psychotropic drugs; (2) provided inadequate mental health care at Rader, particularly as to screening, assessment, treatment and transition planning, and psychiatric and psychological services; and (3) failed to provide required special education services to qualifying Rader residents. Represented by Department of Justice Civil Rights Division attorneys, the federal government initiated the action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &sect; 14141, the pattern or practice provision of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The amended complaint alleged that the state defendants' conduct violated the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. &sect; 794, and related regulations, and the Individuals with Disabilities Act, 20 U.S.C. &sect; 1401.</p>\r\n<p>The case, assigned to District Judge Gregory K. Frizzell, prompted motion and discovery practice resulting in several June 2007, unpublished orders by Magistrate Judge Frank H. McCarthy. These addressed matters such as protective orders to keep disclosed information about residents confidential; scheduling of on-site inspections at Rader by the plaintiff's counsel and expert consultants; who would bear the cost of security escorts during the visits (the United States, said the magistrate); and whether interviews conducted during the visits would have to be recorded (they would).</p>\r\n<p>In June 2008, a settlement was reached and on September 9, 2008, the court (Judge Frizzell) entered an order incorporating the consent decree. The consent decree included resolutions about protecting juvenile residents from harm, prevention of suicide and self-harm, mental health care, and special education claims, and was set to expire three years from the date it was signed.</p>\r\n<p>In September 2011, a little over a week before the consent decree was set to expire, the U.S. filed an emergency motion to modify the decree. The U.S. alleged that since Rader was closed by the state in 2011, there had been several incidents at two \"replacement\" facilities. The U.S. alleged that the defendants had not given them full access to investigate the incidents. The U.S. wanted the consent decree modified to extend to these other facilities so that the incidents could be investigated with the support of the court. The defendants objected, arguing that Rader was the only facility under the order and that the two facilities were not replacements as defined in the consent decree. The court agreed with the defendants, finding that the separate, pre-existing juvenile centers were not replacements under the terms of the consent decree. The defendants then moved to dismiss the case, citing the expiration of the consent decree, which the court granted on November 18, 2011.The case was dismissed with prejudice.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is now closed.</p>",

              "transformed_text": "In December 2006, the United States initiated a legal action against the State of Oklahoma and officials responsible for the L.E. Rader Center, a juvenile detention facility. The federal government, acting through its Civil Rights Division, brought this case because it believed the state was systematically failing to protect the fundamental rights of the juveniles housed there. The amended complaint detailed allegations of inadequate protection from harm by staff and other residents, improper administration of psychotropic drugs, deficient mental health care, and a failure to provide required special education services. This intervention was a strategic move to compel the state to rectify these alleged abuses, asserting violations of the Fourteenth Amendment and federal disability laws.\n\nOnce the lawsuit was filed, both sides engaged in the crucial process of information gathering and setting the stage for the legal proceedings. Orders from the Magistrate Judge during this phase were designed to ensure the integrity of the investigation, such as protecting confidential resident information, facilitating on-site inspections by federal counsel and experts, and establishing the practical rules for collecting evidence, including who would bear the costs and whether interviews needed recording. This period was essential for preparing the groundwork, whether for a potential trial or, as it transpired, a negotiated resolution.\n\nBy June 2008, the parties strategically opted for a settlement rather than a protracted trial. The court formally adopted this agreement as a consent decree, which outlined specific reforms the state committed to implementing at Rader. This pragmatic solution allowed the state to avoid an adverse judicial finding while agreeing to the changes the federal government sought to ensure the safety and well-being of the juveniles, establishing a court-monitored framework for compliance set to expire in three years.\n\nHowever, as the consent decree neared its expiration in September 2011, a new challenge emerged. The U.S. filed an emergency motion, seeking to modify the decree because Rader had closed and incidents were reported at two \"replacement\" facilities. This was a strategic attempt by the federal government to maintain judicial oversight and ensure the reforms continued to protect juveniles, even if they were moved. The defendants, however, strategically objected, arguing that the decree's terms were specific to Rader and did not encompass these other facilities. The court sided with the defendants, finding the pre-existing centers were not \"replacements\" under the decree's terms. With the original mandate's scope limited and its expiration imminent, the defendants then successfully moved to dismiss the entire case in November 2011, effectively ending the federal government's direct oversight.",

This outcome traces back to a legal agreement originally established to address systematic failures and protect the fundamental rights of juveniles at the L.E. Rader Center, following allegations of Fourteenth Amendment and federal disability law violations. That agreement, a consent decree, outlined specific reforms for Rader.\n\nHowever, when the Rader Center closed, a key question emerged: could this specific agreement be extended to other juvenile facilities? The United States sought to modify the decree, arguing that reported incidents at other centers necessitated continued oversight, viewing them as \"replacement\" facilities. The state of Oklahoma, however, successfully argued that the decree's terms were explicitly limited to Rader and did not encompass these other pre-existing facilities. Consequently, the court agreed with the state, determining these facilities did not qualify as \"replacements\" under the original agreement. With the decree's scope thus confined and its expiration imminent, federal oversight ended, leaving the conditions in other state juvenile facilities outside the purview of this particular agreement.",

        "summary": "<p>On December 18, 2015, almost three years after the former Rensselaer County Democratic Elections Commissioner was acquitted in state court of forging absentee ballots in a local primary election, he filed this suit against the County of Rensselaer and multiple individuals who he alleged were involved in his prosecution, including the Special District Attorney for the County. The plaintiff filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 for violations of the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged malicious prosecution without probable cause and argued that the Special District Attorney fabricated evidence to pursue criminal charges against him. The plaintiff sought compensatory and punitive damages, medical expenses and costs, and attorneys&rsquo; fees. U.S. District Judge Mae A. D&rsquo;Agostino presided over this case.</p>\r\n<p>On September 30, 2016, the district court ruled on multiple motions to dismiss, dismissing five defendants from the action, and granting in part and denying in part another defendant&rsquo;s motion to dismiss. While the district court found that the plaintiff had adequately pleaded facts to support a malicious prosecution claim against one of the defendants, the court dismissed the plaintiff&rsquo;s fabrication of evidence claims against all the defendants on statute of limitations grounds. Three months later, the district court ruled on three more motions to dismiss. First, the court dismissed the County as a defendant, reasoning that a municipality cannot be held liable solely based on the actions of city employees. The court also dismissed the Special District Attorney as a defendant, finding that he was entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity. Lastly, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss by a defendant who was assigned to assist the Special District Attorney in the investigation of the plaintiff. The court found that the defendant was entitled to absolute immunity for his grand jury and trial testimony. However, it also found that plaintiff had sufficiently alleged that the defendant acted in conjunction with the Special District Attorney to maliciously prosecute the plaintiff by ignoring or failing to obtain evidence that would have incriminated other defendants in order to continue prosecuting the plaintiff. 2016 WL 7496128.</p>\r\n<p>On January 27, 2017, the plaintiff appealed both the district court&rsquo;s dismissal of his fabrication of evidence claim and the court&rsquo;s finding that the Special District Attorney was entitled to absolute immunity for the malicious prosecution claim. On August 3, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the district court&rsquo;s holding that the Special District Attorney was entitled to absolute immunity for the malicious prosecution claim given that the malicious prosecution claim related to actions he took while acting in a prosecutorial capacity. The Second Circuit also held that the fabricated-evidence claim was properly dismissed as untimely given that the limitations period began to run when the plaintiff was arrested and stood trial, not when the plaintiff was acquitted. 898 F.3d 259.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff subsequently appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to resolve the question of when the statute of limitations for a fabricated-evidence claim begins to run. The district court stayed discovery and further proceedings pending the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision. On June 19, 2019, the Supreme Court held that the limitations period began to run when the criminal proceedings against the plaintiff terminated in his favor, and thus reversed and remanded the case. 588 U.S. 109.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff filed an amended complaint on June 8, 2020, against five defendants, alleging that they fabricated evidence against him and maliciously prosecuted him without probable cause, and that both of those actions violated the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. However, on October 30, 2020, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the amended complaint against four defendants, leaving the Special District Attorney as the only remaining defendant.</p>\r\n<p>The Special District Attorney subsequently moved to dismiss and, in the alternative, moved for summary judgment. On August 11, 2022, the district court granted the Special District Attorney&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment, dismissed the plaintiff&rsquo;s amended complaint with prejudice, and ordered judgment in favor of the defendant, finding that nothing in the record suggested that the defendant fabricated evidence or coerced individuals into perjuring themselves. 2022 WL 3279348.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is now closed.</p>",

              "transformed_text": "On December 18, 2015, almost three years after the former Rensselaer County Democratic Elections Commissioner was acquitted in state court of forging absentee ballots in a local primary election, he filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the County of Rensselaer and multiple individuals who he alleged were involved in his prosecution, including the Special District Attorney for the County. The plaintiff alleged violations of his Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, specifically asserting malicious prosecution without probable cause and arguing that the Special District Attorney fabricated evidence to pursue criminal charges against him. The plaintiff sought compensatory and punitive damages, medical expenses and costs, and attorneys’ fees. U.S. District Judge Mae A. D’Agostino presided over this case.\n\nThe district court subsequently ruled on multiple motions to dismiss, dismissing five defendants from the action, and granting in part and denying in part another defendant’s motion to dismiss. While the district court found that the plaintiff had adequately pleaded facts to support a malicious prosecution claim against one of the defendants, the court dismissed the plaintiff’s fabrication of evidence claims against all the defendants on statute of limitations grounds. The court later dismissed the County, reasoning a municipality cannot be held liable solely based on employee actions. The court also dismissed the Special District Attorney as a defendant, finding that he was entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity. Lastly, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss by a defendant assigned to assist the Special District Attorney in the investigation of the plaintiff. The court found this defendant was entitled to absolute immunity for his grand jury and trial testimony. However, it also found that plaintiff had sufficiently alleged that the defendant acted in conjunction with the Special District Attorney to maliciously prosecute the plaintiff by ignoring or failing to obtain evidence that would have incriminated other defendants to continue prosecuting the plaintiff.\n\nThe plaintiff appealed both the district court’s dismissal of his fabrication of evidence claim and the Special District Attorney's absolute immunity for the malicious prosecution claim. On August 3, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the district court’s finding of absolute prosecutorial immunity for the Special District Attorney, given the malicious prosecution claim related to actions taken in a prosecutorial capacity. The Second Circuit also held that the fabricated-evidence claim was properly dismissed as untimely given that the limitations period began to run when the plaintiff was arrested and stood trial, not when the plaintiff was acquitted.\n\nThe plaintiff subsequently appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to resolve the question of when the statute of limitations for a fabricated-evidence claim begins to run. The district court stayed discovery and further proceedings pending the Supreme Court’s decision. On June 19, 2019, the Supreme Court held that the limitations period began to run when the criminal proceedings against the plaintiff terminated in his favor, and thus reversed and remanded the case.\n\nFollowing remand, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint against five defendants, alleging that they fabricated evidence against him and maliciously prosecuted him without probable cause, and that these actions violated his Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. However, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the amended complaint against four defendants, leaving the Special District Attorney as the only remaining defendant.\n\nThe Special District Attorney subsequently moved to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. On August 11, 2022, the district court granted the Special District Attorney’s motion for summary judgment, dismissed the plaintiff’s amended complaint with prejudice, and ordered judgment in favor of the defendant, finding that nothing in the record suggested that the defendant fabricated evidence or coerced individuals into perjuring themselves.\n\nThis case is now closed.",

The plaintiff filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 for violations of the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged malicious prosecution without probable cause and argued that the Special District Attorney fabricated evidence to pursue criminal charges against him. The plaintiff sought compensatory and punitive damages, medical expenses and costs, and attorneys&rsquo; fees. U.S. District Judge Mae A. D&rsquo;Agostino presided over this case.</p>\r\n<p>On September 30, 2016, the district court ruled on multiple motions to dismiss, dismissing five defendants from the action, and granting in part and denying in part another defendant&rsquo;s motion to dismiss. While the district court found that the plaintiff had adequately pleaded facts to support a malicious prosecution claim against one of the defendants, the court dismissed the plaintiff&rsquo;s fabrication of evidence claims against all the defendants on statute of limitations grounds. Three months later, the district court ruled on three more motions to dismiss. First, the court dismissed the County as a defendant, reasoning that a municipality cannot be held liable solely based on the actions of city employees. The court also dismissed the Special District Attorney as a defendant, finding that he was entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity. Lastly, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss by a defendant who was assigned to assist the Special District Attorney in the investigation of the plaintiff. The court found that the defendant was entitled to absolute immunity for his grand jury and trial testimony. However, it also found that plaintiff had sufficiently alleged that the defendant acted in conjunction with the Special District Attorney to maliciously prosecute the plaintiff by ignoring or failing to obtain evidence that would have incriminated other defendants in order to continue prosecuting the plaintiff. 2016 WL 7496128.</p>\r\n<p>On January 27, 2017, the plaintiff appealed both the district court&rsquo;s dismissal of his fabrication of evidence claim and the court&rsquo;s finding that the Special District Attorney was entitled to absolute immunity for the malicious prosecution claim. On August 3, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the district court&rsquo;s holding that the Special District Attorney was entitled to absolute immunity for the malicious prosecution claim given that the malicious prosecution claim related to actions he took while acting in a prosecutorial capacity.

              "transformed_text": "On December 18, 2015, almost three years after a former Rensselaer County Democratic Elections Commissioner was found not guilty in state court of faking absentee ballots in a local primary election, he sued Rensselaer County and several people he claimed were involved in his prosecution, including the County's Special District Attorney. He filed this lawsuit in federal court (U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York) under a law called 42 U.S.C. § 1983. He claimed his constitutional rights under the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments were violated. Specifically, he claimed he was maliciously prosecuted (meaning he was wrongly prosecuted without good reason) and that the Special District Attorney made up evidence to bring criminal charges against him. He asked for money to cover his losses (compensatory damages), extra money to punish the defendants (punitive damages), medical expenses, and legal fees. U.S. District Judge Mae A. D’Agostino oversaw the case.\n\nOn September 30, 2016, the district court decided on several motions to dismiss the case. The court dismissed five defendants entirely and partly granted, partly denied another defendant’s request to dismiss. The court found the plaintiff had presented enough facts to support his malicious prosecution claim against one defendant. However, it dismissed his claims that evidence was fabricated against all defendants because the lawsuit was filed too late (due to the \"statute of limitations\"). Three months later, the district court made decisions on three more requests to dismiss. First, the court dismissed the County as a defendant, explaining that a local government cannot be held responsible just because its employees acted wrongly. The court also dismissed the Special District Attorney, ruling that he had \"absolute prosecutorial immunity,\" meaning he was protected from lawsuits for actions taken as a prosecutor. Finally, the court partly granted and partly denied the motion to dismiss from a defendant who helped the Special District Attorney investigate the plaintiff. The court found this defendant was also protected by \"absolute immunity\" for what he said when testifying to the grand jury and at trial. However, the court also found that the plaintiff had sufficiently claimed that this defendant worked with the Special District Attorney to wrongly prosecute him. This was done by ignoring or failing to get evidence that would have shown other defendants were guilty, so they could keep prosecuting the plaintiff instead. 2016 WL 7496128.\n\nOn January 27, 2017, the plaintiff appealed two of the district court's decisions: the dismissal of his claim that evidence was fabricated, and the ruling that the Special District Attorney had \"absolute immunity\" for the malicious prosecution claim. On August 3, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit agreed with the district court. They upheld the decision that the Special District Attorney had \"absolute immunity\" for the malicious prosecution claim because his actions were part of his job as a prosecutor. The Second Circuit also ruled that the fabricated-evidence claim was correctly dismissed as being filed too late. They said the time limit for filing the claim started when the plaintiff was arrested and went to trial, not when he was found not guilty. 898 F.3d 259.\n\nThe plaintiff then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case (granted \"certiorari\") to decide when the time limit for filing a fabricated-evidence claim actually begins. The district court paused the collection of evidence (\"discovery\") and other legal steps until the Supreme Court made its decision. On June 19, 2019, the Supreme Court ruled that the time limit started when the criminal case against the plaintiff ended in his favor. Because of this, they overturned the lower court's decision and sent the case back for further action (\"reversed and remanded\"). 588 U.S. 109.\n\nThe plaintiff filed an updated complaint on June 8, 2020, against five defendants. He claimed they fabricated evidence and maliciously prosecuted him without good reason, and that both actions violated his Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. However, on October 30, 2020, the plaintiff chose to drop the case against four of the defendants, leaving only the Special District Attorney as the sole defendant.\n\nThe Special District Attorney then asked the court to dismiss the case, or alternatively, to rule in his favor without a trial (\"summary judgment\"). On August 11, 2022, the district court granted the Special District Attorney's request for summary judgment. This meant the plaintiff's updated complaint was dismissed permanently (\"with prejudice\"), and the court ruled in favor of the defendant. The court found no evidence in the case file to suggest the defendant fabricated evidence or forced people to lie under oath (\"perjure themselves\"). 2022 WL 3279348.\n\nThis case is now closed.",

The court said a local government is not always responsible just because its workers might have done something wrong. The court also dismissed the special lawyer. The court said he had a special shield. This shield protects lawyers who handle crimes from lawsuits for things they do as part of their job. Lastly, the court partly agreed and partly disagreed with a request to throw out the case. This request came from someone who helped the special lawyer investigate the man. The court said this person also had full legal protection. This was for what he said when he spoke to the grand jury and at the trial. But the court also found enough information. It looked like this person worked with the special lawyer to wrongly put the man on trial. The man said they did this by ignoring or not getting proof that would have shown other people were guilty. Their main goal was to keep going after him.\n\nOn January 27, 2017, the man did not agree with two of the court's decisions. He asked a higher court to look at them. He appealed the decision that threw out his claim about fake proof. He also appealed the decision that the special lawyer was protected by the special shield for the false accusation claim. On August 3, 2018, a higher court looked at the case. It was called the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. It agreed with the first court. They said the special lawyer was protected by the special shield for the false accusation claim. This was because his actions were part of his job. The higher court also said the claim about fake proof was thrown out correctly. It was filed too late. They said the time limit for that claim started when the man was arrested and went to trial. It did not start when he was found not guilty.\n\nThe man then asked the highest court in the country to hear his case. This was the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. This is a very big deal. They wanted to decide exactly when the time limit for filing a fake proof claim should start. The first court put a pause on collecting proof and other legal steps. This was until the Supreme Court made its decision. On June 19, 2019, the Supreme Court made a rule. It said the time limit actually started when the criminal case against the man ended in his favor. This meant he was found not guilty. Because of this, they changed the lower court's decision. They sent the case back to the lower court. It would be handled again.\n\nOn June 8, 2020, the man filed a new lawsuit. It was against five people. He said they made up fake proof. He also said they wrongly put him on trial without a good reason. He said both actions broke his basic rights under the Constitution. But on October 30, 2020, he decided to stop the case against four of them. This left only the special lawyer as the last person he was suing.\n\nThe special lawyer then asked the court to throw out the case. Or, he asked for a decision in his favor without a full trial. On August 11, 2022, the court agreed with the special lawyer's request. This meant the man's new lawsuit was thrown out for good. He could not sue on those claims again. The court ruled for the special lawyer. The court found no proof that he made up fake evidence. It also found no proof that he made people lie in court.\n\nThis case is now closed.",

              "text": "<p>On December 18, 2015, almost three years after the former Rensselaer County Democratic Elections Commissioner was acquitted in state court of forging absentee ballots in a local primary election, he filed this suit against the County of Rensselaer and multiple individuals who he alleged were involved in his prosecution, including the Special District Attorney for the County. The plaintiff filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 for violations of the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged malicious prosecution without probable cause and argued that the Special District Attorney fabricated evidence to pursue criminal charges against him. The plaintiff sought compensatory and punitive damages, medical expenses and costs, and attorneys&rsquo; fees. U.S. District Judge Mae A. D&rsquo;Agostino presided over this case.</p>\r\n<p>On September 30, 2016, the district court ruled on multiple motions to dismiss, dismissing five defendants from the action, and granting in part and denying in part another defendant&rsquo;s motion to dismiss. While the district court found that the plaintiff had adequately pleaded facts to support a malicious prosecution claim against one of the defendants, the court dismissed the plaintiff&rsquo;s fabrication of evidence claims against all the defendants on statute of limitations grounds. Three months later, the district court ruled on three more motions to dismiss. First, the court dismissed the County as a defendant, reasoning that a municipality cannot be held liable solely based on the actions of city employees. The court also dismissed the Special District Attorney as a defendant, finding that he was entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity. Lastly, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss by a defendant who was assigned to assist the Special District Attorney in the investigation of the plaintiff. The court found that the defendant was entitled to absolute immunity for his grand jury and trial testimony. However, it also found that plaintiff had sufficiently alleged that the defendant acted in conjunction with the Special District Attorney to maliciously prosecute the plaintiff by ignoring or failing to obtain evidence that would have incriminated other defendants in order to continue prosecuting the plaintiff. 2016 WL 7496128.</p>\r\n<p>On January 27, 2017, the plaintiff appealed both the district court&rsquo;s dismissal of his fabrication of evidence claim and the court&rsquo;s finding that the Special District Attorney was entitled to absolute immunity for the malicious prosecution claim. On August 3, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the district court&rsquo;s holding that the Special District Attorney was entitled to absolute immunity for the malicious prosecution claim given that the malicious prosecution claim related to actions he took while acting in a prosecutorial capacity. The Second Circuit also held that the fabricated-evidence claim was properly dismissed as untimely given that the limitations period began to run when the plaintiff was arrested and stood trial, not when the plaintiff was acquitted. 898 F.3d 259.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff subsequently appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to resolve the question of when the statute of limitations for a fabricated-evidence claim begins to run. The district court stayed discovery and further proceedings pending the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision. On June 19, 2019, the Supreme Court held that the limitations period began to run when the criminal proceedings against the plaintiff terminated in his favor, and thus reversed and remanded the case. 588 U.S. 109.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff filed an amended complaint on June 8, 2020, against five defendants, alleging that they fabricated evidence against him and maliciously prosecuted him without probable cause, and that both of those actions violated the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. However, on October 30, 2020, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the amended complaint against four defendants, leaving the Special District Attorney as the only remaining defendant.</p>\r\n<p>The Special District Attorney subsequently moved to dismiss and, in the alternative, moved for summary judgment. On August 11, 2022, the district court granted the Special District Attorney&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment, dismissed the plaintiff&rsquo;s amended complaint with prejudice, and ordered judgment in favor of the defendant, finding that nothing in the record suggested that the defendant fabricated evidence or coerced individuals into perjuring themselves. 2022 WL 3279348.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is now closed.</p>",

              "transformed_text": "Years after his acquittal in a state court trial for forging absentee ballots, the former Rensselaer County Democratic Elections Commissioner initiated a federal lawsuit on December 18, 2015. He sought to hold accountable the County of Rensselaer and several individuals, including the Special District Attorney, whom he believed had orchestrated his wrongful prosecution. His core contention was that he had been maliciously prosecuted without probable cause, and critically, that the Special District Attorney had fabricated evidence to secure his criminal charges. Through this action, he aimed to recover damages for the harm he had suffered.\n\nThe defendants swiftly responded to the plaintiff's allegations by filing motions to dismiss, a strategic move to end the lawsuit early without the need for a full trial. They argued that the plaintiff's claims lacked legal merit or were procedurally flawed. On September 30, 2016, the district court largely sided with the defendants, removing five individuals from the suit and dismissing the plaintiff's fabrication of evidence claims against all parties, citing that too much time had passed since the alleged wrongdoing. Later, the court further narrowed the case, dismissing the County itself, on the principle that a government entity isn't automatically responsible for its employees' actions. Crucially, the Special District Attorney was also dismissed, as the court determined he was shielded by absolute prosecutorial immunity for his actions. However, the court allowed a claim for malicious prosecution to proceed against one defendant, an assistant to the Special District Attorney, acknowledging the plaintiff's compelling argument that this individual had acted in concert to maliciously prosecute him by overlooking evidence that might have implicated others.\n\nUnsatisfied with these dismissals, the plaintiff pursued an appeal, seeking to revive his fabrication of evidence claim and challenge the Special District Attorney's immunity. He believed these rulings unjustly curtailed his pursuit of justice. However, on August 3, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit largely affirmed the lower court's decisions. The appellate court agreed that the Special District Attorney was immune for his prosecutorial actions and, significantly, reaffirmed that the time limit for the fabricated-evidence claim began when the plaintiff was arrested and tried, not when he was ultimately acquitted, thus upholding its dismissal as untimely.\n\nUndeterred, the plaintiff brought his case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which took the unusual step of agreeing to hear it. The Court recognized a crucial legal ambiguity: precisely when the clock should start ticking for a fabricated-evidence claim's statute of limitations. This was a pivotal question for the plaintiff, as its resolution would determine if his claim could proceed. On June 19, 2019, the Supreme Court sided with the plaintiff, ruling that the limitations period began only when the criminal proceedings against him concluded in his favor. This landmark decision breathed new life into his case, reversing the lower court's dismissal and sending the matter back for further proceedings.\n\nWith the Supreme Court's ruling in hand, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint on June 8, 2020, renewing his allegations of fabricated evidence and malicious prosecution against five defendants. However, in a strategic move to streamline the case, he voluntarily dismissed four of these defendants on October 30, 2020, choosing to focus his efforts solely on the Special District Attorney.\n\nThe Special District Attorney, now the sole defendant, again sought to end the litigation, this time by moving for summary judgment. This motion aimed to demonstrate that there was no genuine dispute of material fact and that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, thereby avoiding a trial. On August 11, 2022, the district court agreed, granting summary judgment in his favor. The court found no evidence in the extensive record to support the plaintiff's claims that the Special District Attorney had fabricated evidence or coerced witnesses. This final ruling brought the long-running legal battle to a close.\n\nThus, the case was finally closed.",

Though he had been cleared of ballot forgery charges, he carried the heavy burden of believing he had been unfairly targeted. He felt that the Special District Attorney and others had maliciously pursued him, even going so far as to invent evidence against him.\n\n**The Fight:** Driven by his conviction that he had been wronged, the Commissioner decided to confront those he held responsible. His journey was difficult, with initial attempts to bring his concerns forward being dismissed. Yet, a pivotal moment arrived when the nation's highest court weighed in, providing a crucial clarification that offered him renewed hope and a way for his case to move forward. With this new clarity, he focused his accusations directly on the Special District Attorney, convinced that this individual was at the heart of the fabricated claims and coercion.\n\n**The Resolution:** Despite the glimmer of hope and his focused pursuit, the story reached its conclusion. After a comprehensive examination of all the facts, the court determined there was no evidence to support the Commissioner's serious claims that the Special District Attorney had invented evidence or pressured witnesses to lie. This final decision brought the long and arduous dispute to a definitive close, with the Special District Attorney ultimately found to have acted properly.",
