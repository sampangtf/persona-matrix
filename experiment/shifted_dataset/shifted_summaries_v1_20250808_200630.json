        "summary": "<p>On April 8, 2020, the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association, the Capital Area Private Defender Service, the Austin Criminal Defense Lawyers Association, and several other organizations filed a lawsuit against the State of Texas, challenging Governor Abbott&rsquo;s order to limit bail release across the state.</p>\r\n<p>On March 29, Governor Abbott issued executive order GA-13, which removed the discretion from judges regarding who could receive personal bonds, and banned the use of personal bonds for certain detainees. Specifically, the order prohibited the no-cost release of people accused of violent offenses, or those previously convicted of a violent felony. However, those who were able to pay bail could still be released on personal bonds regardless of their charges.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs alleged that the order created a &ldquo;wealth-based system&rdquo; of release and discriminated against those unable to afford cash bail. Further, the plaintiffs noted that GA-13 worsened prison overcrowding by holding individuals in pretrial detention at a time when jails populations already faced heightened susceptibility to COVID-19. The plaintiffs alleged that GA-13 suspended the Texas Code of Criminal Code Procedure pertaining to release and the discretion of judges on release decisions. The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendant overstepped this statutory and constitutional authority as Governor in violation of the Texas Disaster Act 1975 and the Texas Constitution, which states that the power to suspend laws lies with the legislature.</p>\r\n<p>Included in the group of plaintiffs were sixteen of Harris County&rsquo;s judges, who sued in response to GA-13&rsquo;s changes in rules regarding judges&rsquo; decisions regarding pre-trial bail. First, the judicial plaintiffs alleged that GA-13 improperly deprived them of the judicial discretion to consider pre-trial released granted by the Texas constitution. Second, the judges contended that the order caused confusion among the courts, as judges were forced to choose between applying federal consent decree, mandating individualized bail decisions, versus GA-13, which prohibited all discretion on personal bonds. Shortly after Governor Abbott&rsquo;s order, in a separate case, County Judge Lina Hidalgo issued an order to release pretrial detention inmates on April 1. On April 3, another Harris County judge blocked the release of the individuals specified in Judge Hidaglo&rsquo;s decision,<a href=\"https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2020/04/03/list-inmates-who-will-be-released-from-harris-county-jail-amid-coronavirus-crisis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">resulting in a conflicting order</a>. Additionally, another competing federal civil rights request was filed, seeking an emergency injunction for those being held pretrial due to a lack of bail funds.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that GA-13 was unconstitutional, as well as a temporary and permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from enforcing GA-13. The plaintiffs also sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) to preserve the status quo, pending the decision on the validity of GA-13 and attorney fees. The plaintiffs were represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas and the Texas Fair Defense Project. The case was assigned to Judge Lee Rosenthal.</p>\r\n<p>On April 10, the district court granted the TRO, citing unconstitutional provisions and overreach of executive power by the Governor. The following day, the defendants filed an appeal to the Texas Supreme court, seeking to vacate the district court&rsquo;s TRO. That same day, April 11, the Texas Supreme Court granted the stay, reviving Abbott&rsquo;s order. The plaintiffs submitted a response in opposition to the appellants&rsquo; writ of mandamus on April 13.</p>\r\n<p>On April 23, the Texas Supreme Court conditionally granted mandamus and overturned the district court&rsquo;s TRO. The Supreme Court decided that the sixteen judicial plaintiffs&rsquo; alleged injury due to GA-13 was too generalized to create a legal standing. Therefore, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to rule in favor of the judges&rsquo; authority to make individualized bail decisions when the TRO was issued.</p>\r\n<p>On November 4, 2020, the plaintiffs requested to dismiss the case, which was granted; the case is now closed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "summary_short": "This case is a challenge against the Governor of Texas’ order to limit bail, filed by the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association and sixteen Harris County Judges. On March 29, Governor Abbott removed the discretion from judges regarding who can receive personal bonds, and banned the use of personal bonds for detainees accused of violent offenses. The plaintiffs alleged that the order discriminated against those unable to afford cash bail and hampered efforts to reduce jail populations during the pandemic. The plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that the order was unconstitutional, as well as a temporary and permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from enforcing it. The plaintiffs also sought a TRO (temporary restraining order) to preserve the status quo pending the decision on the validity of the defendant’s order. On April 10, the court granted the TRO. The following day, the defendants filed an appeal to the Texas Supreme court, and the Texas Supreme Court issued a stay on the TRO, reviving Abbott’s order. On April 23, the Texas Supreme Court overturned the district court’s decision, after finding that the judicial plaintiffs lacked standing and therefore lacked subject matter jurisdiction.

They challenged Governor Abbott’s executive order GA-13, issued March 29, which eliminated judicial discretion over personal bonds for detainees accused of violent offenses or previously convicted of violent felonies, while allowing release for those able to pay bail regardless of charges. Plaintiffs contended GA-13 established a \"wealth-based system,\" suspended the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, and exceeded the Governor's statutory and constitutional authority under the Texas Disaster Act 1975 and the Texas Constitution. The judicial plaintiffs specifically alleged GA-13 improperly deprived them of constitutionally granted judicial discretion over pre-trial release.\n*   On April 10, the district court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO), citing unconstitutional provisions and executive overreach, effectively pausing GA-13's enforcement.\n*   The defendants immediately appealed, and on April 11, the Texas Supreme Court granted a stay of the TRO, thereby reviving GA-13. Subsequently, on April 23, the Supreme Court conditionally granted mandamus, overturning the district court’s TRO.

Specifically, the order prohibited the no-cost release of people accused of violent offenses, or those previously convicted of a violent felony. However, those who were able to pay bail could still be released on personal bonds regardless of their charges.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs alleged that the order created a &ldquo;wealth-based system&rdquo; of release and discriminated against those unable to afford cash bail. Further, the plaintiffs noted that GA-13 worsened prison overcrowding by holding individuals in pretrial detention at a time when jails populations already faced heightened susceptibility to COVID-19. The plaintiffs alleged that GA-13 suspended the Texas Code of Criminal Code Procedure pertaining to release and the discretion of judges on release decisions. The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendant overstepped this statutory and constitutional authority as Governor in violation of the Texas Disaster Act 1975 and the Texas Constitution, which states that the power to suspend laws lies with the legislature.</p>\r\n<p>Included in the group of plaintiffs were sixteen of Harris County&rsquo;s judges, who sued in response to GA-13&rsquo;s changes in rules regarding judges&rsquo; decisions regarding pre-trial bail. First, the judicial plaintiffs alleged that GA-13 improperly deprived them of the judicial discretion to consider pre-trial released granted by the Texas constitution. Second, the judges contended that the order caused confusion among the courts, as judges were forced to choose between applying federal consent decree, mandating individualized bail decisions, versus GA-13, which prohibited all discretion on personal bonds. Shortly after Governor Abbott&rsquo;s order, in a separate case, County Judge Lina Hidalgo issued an order to release pretrial detention inmates on April 1. On April 3, another Harris County judge blocked the release of the individuals specified in Judge Hidaglo&rsquo;s decision,<a href=\"https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2020/04/03/list-inmates-who-will-be-released-from-harris-county-jail-amid-coronavirus-crisis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">resulting in a conflicting order</a>. Additionally, another competing federal civil rights request was filed, seeking an emergency injunction for those being held pretrial due to a lack of bail funds.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that GA-13 was unconstitutional, as well as a temporary and permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from enforcing GA-13. The plaintiffs also sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) to preserve the status quo, pending the decision on the validity of GA-13 and attorney fees. The plaintiffs were represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas and the Texas Fair Defense Project. The case was assigned to Judge Lee Rosenthal.</p>\r\n<p>On April 10, the district court granted the TRO, citing unconstitutional provisions and overreach of executive power by the Governor. The following day, the defendants filed an appeal to the Texas Supreme court, seeking to vacate the district court&rsquo;s TRO. That same day, April 11, the Texas Supreme Court granted the stay, reviving Abbott&rsquo;s order. The plaintiffs submitted a response in opposition to the appellants&rsquo; writ of mandamus on April 13.</p>\r\n<p>On April 23, the Texas Supreme Court conditionally granted mandamus and overturned the district court&rsquo;s TRO. The Supreme Court decided that the sixteen judicial plaintiffs&rsquo; alleged injury due to GA-13 was too generalized to create a legal standing. Therefore, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to rule in favor of the judges&rsquo; authority to make individualized bail decisions when the TRO was issued.</p>\r\n<p>On November 4, 2020, the plaintiffs requested to dismiss the case, which was granted; the case is now closed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

They also pointed out that GA-13 made jail overcrowding worse by keeping people in jail before trial, especially when jail populations were already at high risk for COVID-19. The plaintiffs argued that GA-13 overrode parts of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure related to release and judges' power to make release decisions. They also claimed the Governor went beyond his legal and constitutional authority, violating the Texas Disaster Act of 1975 and the Texas Constitution, which states that only the legislature can suspend laws.\n\nAmong the plaintiffs were sixteen judges from Harris County. They sued because GA-13 changed the rules for judges' decisions on pre-trial bail. First, these judges claimed that GA-13 wrongly took away their power to decide on pre-trial release, a power given to them by the Texas Constitution. Second, the judges argued the order created confusion in the courts. Judges had to choose between following a federal court order that required individualized bail decisions and GA-13, which banned all discretion for personal bonds. Soon after Governor Abbott's order, in a different case, Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo ordered the release of inmates held before trial on April 1. On April 3, another Harris County judge stopped the release of those specific individuals, leading to a conflicting order. Also, a separate federal civil rights request was filed, asking for an emergency order to release those held before trial because they couldn't afford bail.\n\nThe plaintiffs asked the court to declare GA-13 unconstitutional. They also sought temporary and permanent orders (injunctions) to stop the defendants from enforcing GA-13. The plaintiffs also asked for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to keep things as they were until the court decided if GA-13 was valid. They also sought attorney fees. The American Civil Liberties Union of Texas and the Texas Fair Defense Project represented the plaintiffs. Judge Lee Rosenthal was assigned to the case.\n\nOn April 10, the district court granted the TRO, stating that parts of the order were unconstitutional and that the Governor had overstepped his executive power. The next day, the defendants appealed to the Texas Supreme Court, asking to cancel the district court's TRO. That same day, April 11, the Texas Supreme Court put a hold on the TRO, which brought Governor Abbott's order back into effect. The plaintiffs responded on April 13, opposing the defendants' request for a writ of mandamus.\n\nOn April 23, the Texas Supreme Court agreed to the request for mandamus and overturned the district court's TRO. The Supreme Court decided that the harm the sixteen judges claimed from GA-13 was too general for them to have the legal right to sue (known as 'standing'). Because of this, the district court did not have the authority (jurisdiction) to rule in favor of the judges' power to make individualized bail decisions when it issued the TRO.\n\nOn November 4, 2020, the plaintiffs asked to drop the case. This request was granted, and the case is now closed.",

This order took away judges' power to decide who could get a \"personal bond,\" which allows someone to be released from jail without paying money. It also stopped certain people in jail from being released on these bonds. Specifically, it prevented people accused of violent crimes or those with past violent felony convictions from being released without paying bail. But if someone could afford to pay cash bail, they could still get out, no matter what they were accused of.\n\nThe groups suing argued that the order created a \"wealth-based system\" for release, meaning it unfairly favored those who could afford to pay bail over those who couldn't. They also said GA-13 made jails more crowded by keeping more people locked up before their trials, especially at a time when COVID-19 posed a high risk to jail populations. The plaintiffs claimed GA-13 went against parts of Texas law that deal with how people are released and how judges make decisions about release. They also argued the Governor overstepped his legal and constitutional power, violating a law called the Texas Disaster Act of 1975 and the Texas Constitution, which says only the state legislature can put laws on hold.\n\nAmong those suing were sixteen judges from Harris County. They joined the lawsuit because GA-13 changed how judges could make decisions about bail before a trial. First, these judges argued that GA-13 improperly removed their authority to decide who could be released before trial, a power granted to them by the Texas Constitution. Second, the judges said the order caused confusion in the courts.

However, on April 3, another Harris County judge blocked the release of those same individuals, creating a conflicting order. Separately, a federal civil rights request was also filed, asking a court to immediately order the release of people held before trial because they couldn't afford bail.\n\nThe plaintiffs asked the court to rule that GA-13 was unconstitutional, meaning it violated the law. They also requested temporary and permanent court orders, called \"injunctions,\" to prevent the state from enforcing GA-13. They also sought a temporary restraining order, or TRO, which is a quick court order to temporarily stop something from happening until the court can make a full decision on whether GA-13 was legal. They also asked for their legal fees to be covered. The American Civil Liberties Union of Texas and the Texas Fair Defense Project represented the plaintiffs. Judge Lee Rosenthal was assigned to the case.\n\nOn April 10, the lower court approved the temporary restraining order, saying parts of Governor Abbott's order were unconstitutional and that he had gone too far with his executive power. The very next day, the state appealed to the Texas Supreme Court, asking them to cancel the lower court's temporary order. On April 11, the Texas Supreme Court put the temporary order on hold, which meant Governor Abbott's original order was back in force. The plaintiffs responded on April 13, arguing against the state's request for a \"writ of mandamus,\" which is a court order from a higher court telling a lower court or official to do something.\n\nOn April 23, the Texas Supreme Court sided with the state's request and overturned the lower court's temporary order. The Supreme Court ruled that the harm the sixteen judges claimed from GA-13 was too broad for them to have the legal right to bring the lawsuit in the first place, a concept known as \"standing.\" Because the judges lacked standing, the lower court did not have the legal power, or \"jurisdiction,\" to rule in favor of the judges' authority to make individual bail decisions when it issued the temporary order.\n\nOn November 4, 2020, the plaintiffs asked to drop the case. This request was granted, and the case is now closed.",

              "transformed_text": "On April 8, 2020, a few groups, like the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association, took the State of Texas to court. They were challenging an order from Governor Abbott that changed how people could get out of jail on bail while waiting for their trial.\n\nOn March 29, Governor Abbott issued an emergency order, called GA-13. Think of it like a new rule. This rule took away judges' ability to decide who could get a \"personal bond.\" A personal bond is like a promise to show up in court, letting someone leave jail without having to pay any money. The order specifically said that people accused of violent crimes or who had been convicted of violent crimes before could not get out on these no-cost bonds. But, here's the catch: if someone could afford to pay cash bail, they could still get out, even if they were accused of the same violent crimes.\n\nThe groups who sued argued that this order created a system based on how much money you had. It was like saying, \"If you're rich, you can get out; if you're poor, you stay in.\" They also pointed out that GA-13 made jails even more crowded, keeping more people locked up before their trials. This was especially risky because COVID-19 was spreading, and crowded jails are dangerous during a pandemic. The groups claimed that GA-13 went against existing Texas laws about how people are released and how judges make decisions about release. They also argued that the Governor went beyond his legal and constitutional powers, breaking a law called the Texas Disaster Act of 1975 and the Texas Constitution. The Constitution, like our nation's Constitution, sets limits on power, and in Texas, it says only the state's lawmakers (the legislature) can pause or change laws.\n\nInterestingly, sixteen judges from Harris County were also part of the lawsuit. They joined because GA-13 directly affected their job: making decisions about bail before a trial. First, these judges argued that GA-13 wrongly took away their power to decide who could be released before trial, a power given to them by the Texas Constitution. Second, the judges said the order created a lot of confusion in their courtrooms. They felt stuck between two rules: a federal court order that said they *had* to make individual bail decisions for each person, and GA-13, which told them they *couldn't* use their judgment for personal bonds. It was like being told to drive forward and backward at the same time! Around the same time, in a different case, Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo ordered some people held before trial to be released on April 1. But just two days later, another Harris County judge stopped that release, creating a confusing situation where different judges were giving different orders. Also, a separate request was made to a federal court, asking for an immediate order to release people who were stuck in jail before trial just because they couldn't afford bail.\n\nThe groups suing asked the court to declare that GA-13 was \"unconstitutional,\" which means it went against the state's highest law. They also asked for court orders, called \"injunctions,\" which are like official commands from a judge. They wanted these orders to temporarily and permanently stop the state from using GA-13. They also specifically asked for a \"temporary restraining order,\" or TRO. Think of a TRO as a quick, emergency stop sign from the court, meant to pause something immediately until the court has more time to decide if the rule (GA-13) is truly legal. Finally, they asked for their legal fees to be paid. The American Civil Liberties Union of Texas (ACLU) and the Texas Fair Defense Project were the lawyers for the groups suing. Judge Lee Rosenthal was the judge assigned to hear the case.\n\nOn April 10, the first court (the \"lower court\") agreed to the temporary restraining order. This meant they believed parts of Governor Abbott's order were unconstitutional and that he had used too much of his power as Governor. But the very next day, the State of Texas appealed this decision to the Texas Supreme Court, which is the highest court in the state. They asked the Supreme Court to cancel the lower court's temporary order. And on that same day, April 11, the Texas Supreme Court agreed to pause the temporary order. This meant Governor Abbott's original order was back in effect. The groups who sued responded on April 13, arguing against the state's request for a \"writ of mandamus.\" A writ of mandamus is like a special command from a higher court telling a lower court or a government official to do something specific.\n\nOn April 23, the Texas Supreme Court sided with the state and completely overturned the lower court's temporary order. The Supreme Court said that the harm the sixteen judges claimed from GA-13 was too general for them to have the legal right to even bring the lawsuit. This legal right is called \"standing.\" Think of \"standing\" like needing to prove you've been directly affected by something to be allowed to sue over it. Because the judges didn't have this \"standing,\" the Supreme Court decided that the lower court didn't have the legal power, or \"jurisdiction,\" to make a ruling in favor of the judges' ability to make individual bail decisions when it issued that temporary order.\n\nOn November 4, 2020, the groups who had sued asked to stop the case completely. The court agreed, and so the case is now officially closed.",

This rule changed how people could leave jail before their trial.\n\nOn March 29, Governor Abbott made an emergency rule. It was called GA-13. This rule stopped judges from letting people out of jail on a \"personal bond.\" A personal bond is a promise to come back to court. You don't have to pay money. The rule said people accused of violent crimes could not get out this way. But if someone could pay money, they could still leave jail. This was true even for people accused of violent crimes.\n\nThe groups who sued said this rule was unfair. They said it meant rich people could get out of jail, but poor people had to stay. They also said GA-13 made jails too full. This was bad because COVID-19 was spreading. Crowded jails are dangerous when there's a sickness going around. The groups said GA-13 went against Texas laws. These laws talk about how people leave jail and how judges decide. They also said the Governor used too much power. They said he broke a law from 1975. And they said he broke the Texas Constitution. The Constitution is the state's main rulebook. It says only lawmakers can change laws.\n\nSixteen judges from Harris County also joined the lawsuit. GA-13 changed how they did their job. Their job was to decide about bail. First, the judges said GA-13 took away their power. The Texas Constitution gave them this power. Second, the judges said the rule made things confusing. They had to follow two different rules. One rule from a federal court said they *must* decide bail for each person. But GA-13 said they *could not* use their judgment for personal bonds. It was like trying to go two ways at once! Around that time, another judge, Lina Hidalgo, ordered some people to be let out of jail. This was on April 1. But two days later, a different judge stopped that release. So, judges were giving different orders. Also, someone asked a federal court for a quick order. They wanted people stuck in jail because they couldn't pay bail to be released.\n\nThe groups asked the court to say GA-13 was \"unconstitutional.\" This means it went against the state's main rulebook. They also asked for court orders. These are like official commands from a judge. They wanted these orders to stop the state from using GA-13. They wanted it stopped for a while and then forever. They also asked for a \"temporary restraining order,\" or TRO. A TRO is like a quick stop sign from the court. It pauses something right away. This gives the court time to decide if the rule is legal. Last, they asked for their lawyers to be paid. The ACLU of Texas and the Texas Fair Defense Project were the lawyers. Judge Lee Rosenthal heard the case.\n\nOn April 10, the first court agreed to the quick stop order. This meant the court thought parts of Governor Abbott's rule were against the state's main rulebook. They also thought he used too much power. But the next day, the State of Texas took the case to the Texas Supreme Court. This is the highest court in the state. They asked the Supreme Court to cancel the stop order. On April 11, the Supreme Court agreed to pause the stop order. So, Governor Abbott's original rule was back in place. The groups who sued replied on April 13. They argued against the state's request for a \"writ of mandamus.\" This is a special command from a higher court. It tells a lower court or a leader to do something.\n\nOn April 23, the Texas Supreme Court agreed with the state. They completely canceled the first court's stop order. The Supreme Court said the judges didn't have a strong enough reason to sue. This legal right to sue is called \"standing.\" It means you have to show you were directly hurt by something. Because the judges didn't have \"standing,\" the Supreme Court said the first court didn't have the power to make a ruling for the judges. This was about the judges' power to decide bail for each person.\n\nOn November 4, 2020, the groups who sued asked to end the case. The court said yes. So, the case is now over.",

Specifically, the order prohibited the no-cost release of people accused of violent offenses, or those previously convicted of a violent felony. However, those who were able to pay bail could still be released on personal bonds regardless of their charges.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs alleged that the order created a &ldquo;wealth-based system&rdquo; of release and discriminated against those unable to afford cash bail. Further, the plaintiffs noted that GA-13 worsened prison overcrowding by holding individuals in pretrial detention at a time when jails populations already faced heightened susceptibility to COVID-19. The plaintiffs alleged that GA-13 suspended the Texas Code of Criminal Code Procedure pertaining to release and the discretion of judges on release decisions. The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendant overstepped this statutory and constitutional authority as Governor in violation of the Texas Disaster Act 1975 and the Texas Constitution, which states that the power to suspend laws lies with the legislature.</p>\r\n<p>Included in the group of plaintiffs were sixteen of Harris County&rsquo;s judges, who sued in response to GA-13&rsquo;s changes in rules regarding judges&rsquo; decisions regarding pre-trial bail. First, the judicial plaintiffs alleged that GA-13 improperly deprived them of the judicial discretion to consider pre-trial released granted by the Texas constitution. Second, the judges contended that the order caused confusion among the courts, as judges were forced to choose between applying federal consent decree, mandating individualized bail decisions, versus GA-13, which prohibited all discretion on personal bonds. Shortly after Governor Abbott&rsquo;s order, in a separate case, County Judge Lina Hidalgo issued an order to release pretrial detention inmates on April 1. On April 3, another Harris County judge blocked the release of the individuals specified in Judge Hidaglo&rsquo;s decision,<a href=\"https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2020/04/03/list-inmates-who-will-be-released-from-harris-county-jail-amid-coronavirus-crisis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">resulting in a conflicting order</a>. Additionally, another competing federal civil rights request was filed, seeking an emergency injunction for those being held pretrial due to a lack of bail funds.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that GA-13 was unconstitutional, as well as a temporary and permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from enforcing GA-13. The plaintiffs also sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) to preserve the status quo, pending the decision on the validity of GA-13 and attorney fees. The plaintiffs were represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas and the Texas Fair Defense Project. The case was assigned to Judge Lee Rosenthal.</p>\r\n<p>On April 10, the district court granted the TRO, citing unconstitutional provisions and overreach of executive power by the Governor. The following day, the defendants filed an appeal to the Texas Supreme court, seeking to vacate the district court&rsquo;s TRO. That same day, April 11, the Texas Supreme Court granted the stay, reviving Abbott&rsquo;s order. The plaintiffs submitted a response in opposition to the appellants&rsquo; writ of mandamus on April 13.</p>\r\n<p>On April 23, the Texas Supreme Court conditionally granted mandamus and overturned the district court&rsquo;s TRO. The Supreme Court decided that the sixteen judicial plaintiffs&rsquo; alleged injury due to GA-13 was too generalized to create a legal standing. Therefore, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to rule in favor of the judges&rsquo; authority to make individualized bail decisions when the TRO was issued.</p>\r\n<p>On November 4, 2020, the plaintiffs requested to dismiss the case, which was granted; the case is now closed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

              "transformed_text": "In the spring of 2020, amidst the burgeoning COVID-19 pandemic, a significant legal battle unfolded in Texas, challenging the scope of executive power during a state of disaster. On March 29, Governor Abbott issued Executive Order GA-13, which fundamentally altered the landscape of pre-trial release by limiting judicial discretion over personal bonds, particularly for those accused of violent offenses. Critically, the order permitted release for those able to pay cash bail, regardless of their charges, creating what critics swiftly denounced as a \"wealth-based system\" of detention.\n\nThis executive action prompted a coalition of legal organizations, including the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association and the ACLU of Texas, along with sixteen Harris County judges, to initiate a lawsuit on April 8. Their purpose was clear: to challenge what they perceived as an unconstitutional overreach of gubernatorial authority that not only infringed upon judicial independence but also exacerbated the dangerous conditions of jail overcrowding during a public health crisis. The plaintiffs argued that GA-13 unlawfully suspended existing Texas law and violated the state constitution, which vests the power to suspend laws solely with the legislature. The judges, in particular, sought to defend their constitutional prerogative to make individualized bail decisions, a power they felt was directly undermined by the Governor's order, leading to confusion and conflicting directives within the courts. Their aim was to secure a declaration that GA-13 was unconstitutional and to permanently prevent its enforcement, seeking an immediate temporary restraining order to halt its effects while the case proceeded.\n\nInitially, the district court sided with the challengers, granting the temporary restraining order on April 10. This decision reflected the court's preliminary assessment that the Governor's order likely contained unconstitutional provisions and represented an overreach of executive power. However, this was but a fleeting victory for the plaintiffs. The very next day, the State, acting on behalf of Governor Abbott, swiftly appealed to the Texas Supreme Court, seeking to vacate the temporary restraining order. Their strategic objective was to reassert the Governor's authority and ensure the continued enforcement of GA-13.\n\nOn April 23, the Texas Supreme Court delivered a pivotal ruling, overturning the district court's temporary restraining order. The high court did not delve into the constitutionality of GA-13 itself but rather focused on a procedural matter: it determined that the sixteen judicial plaintiffs lacked the necessary legal standing to bring the challenge, concluding their alleged injury was too generalized. This decision effectively removed the foundation upon which the district court's ruling rested, allowing Governor Abbott's order to be revived and remain in effect. For the plaintiffs, this ruling closed the door on their ability to challenge GA-13 through this particular lawsuit. Faced with this insurmountable procedural barrier, the plaintiffs ultimately requested to dismiss their case on November 4, 2020, bringing an end to this chapter of the legal dispute.",

              "transformed_text": "The central legal conflict in this case revolved around Governor Abbott's Executive Order GA-13, issued during the COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly altered pre-trial release rules by limiting judicial discretion for personal bonds, particularly for those accused of violent offenses. Critics swiftly denounced the order for creating a \"wealth-based system\" by permitting release for those who could pay cash bail regardless of charges, while simultaneously exacerbating concerns about dangerous jail overcrowding. A coalition of legal organizations and sixteen Harris County judges initiated a lawsuit, arguing that GA-13 represented an unconstitutional overreach of gubernatorial authority that infringed upon judicial independence and unlawfully suspended existing Texas law, which vests the power to suspend laws solely with the legislature. The judges, in particular, sought to defend their constitutional prerogative to make individualized bail decisions, a power they felt was directly undermined by the Governor's order.\n\nAfter the district court initially granted a temporary restraining order, the State swiftly appealed to the Texas Supreme Court, seeking to vacate the order and reassert the Governor's authority. The core legal question before the Texas Supreme Court was not the constitutionality of GA-13 itself, but whether the plaintiffs had the legal right to bring the challenge. The Court answered this by determining that the sixteen judicial plaintiffs lacked the necessary legal standing, concluding their alleged injury was too generalized to proceed. This pivotal ruling effectively removed the foundation upon which the district court's decision rested, allowing Governor Abbott's order to be revived and remain in effect. Faced with this insurmountable procedural barrier, the plaintiffs ultimately requested to dismiss their case, bringing an end to this chapter of the legal dispute.",

This rule took away the power of local decision-makers to consider individual situations, meaning that if you couldn't pay money for your release, you stayed locked up, no matter what you were accused of. Many felt this created a system where freedom depended on wealth, not on the details of a person's situation, and it worsened the already crowded conditions.\n\nPeople concerned about fairness, including many judges from Harris County, believed this rule was deeply unfair. They argued the Governor had gone too far, taking away judges' long-held ability to make important choices about who could be released. They wanted to protect the power of judges to consider each person's unique circumstances when deciding if they could go home while awaiting their day in court.\n\nAlthough a local decision-maker initially put a stop to the rule, the state's highest authority later allowed it to start up again. This top authority didn't even consider whether the Governor's rule itself was right or wrong. Instead, it decided that the judges who challenged it didn't have the proper right to bring their complaint. So, the Governor's rule remained in effect, keeping the system of money-based release firmly in place.",

When this suit was filed, the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute operated the only unit in the United States Bureau of Prisons that exclusively held men sentenced to death by federal courts. Referred to as the Special Confinement Unit, individuals incarcerated in the unit were only permitted to leave their single cells a few hours each week. Even when allowed to leave, they were generally denied congregate interactions.</p>\r\n<p>On January 12, 2023, one individual imprisoned in the Special Confinement Unit filed a putative class action suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana against the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons in her official capacity; the Federal Bureau of Prisons; the Warden of the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana in his official and individual capacity; a previous Warden of the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana in his individual capacity; and the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute. Represented by the ACLU and private counsel, the plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, and attorneys&rsquo; fees. The case was assigned to District Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff alleged that the solitary confinement conditions in the Special Confinement Unit violated the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution. According to the complaint, individuals incarcerated in the Special Confinement Unit were generally confined at all times to their cells, which contained a table, a stool, a metal sink, a toilet unit, a shower, and a slit-like window they could not open. Individuals with &ldquo;Phase I&rdquo; status were permitted to leave their cells for solitary recreation one hour a day for five days a week in either a small indoor area with exercise equipment or in individual outdoor recreation cages with a basketball net. When granted &ldquo;Phase II&rdquo; status, the plaintiff alleged they were permitted to engage in the one recreational hour with one other assigned individual. They were also permitted to meet with the assigned individual two days a week for ninety minutes in a small leisure room with books, hot water, and a television. If one&rsquo;s assigned individual refused to go to the recreation or leisure room, one would have solitary recreation or go to the leisure room alone. The plaintiff claimed that recreation and leisure room visits for individuals in &ldquo;Phase II&rdquo; were often canceled and never rescheduled.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>According to the complaint, they were also permitted to leave their cells one hour a day for solitary time in a small room with a computer terminal. Additionally, they could occasionally use another area with six cages for religious services, with the incarcerated individuals locked into each cage individually while a religious leader remained outside of the cages. According to a <a href=\"https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2017/e1705.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> from the Office of the Inspector General, individuals incarcerated remained in &ldquo;Phase I&rdquo; for at least one year and up to an indefinite period of time.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff sued on his own behalf and on behalf of a class of &ldquo;all current and future prisoners confined to death row, currently known as the Special Confinement Unit, at the United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute, Indiana.&rdquo; The plaintiff sued for declaratory relief that the defendants violated the Eighth Amendment. The plaintiff also sued under <em>Ex Parte Young</em> for injunctive relief that would allow the plaintiff and the putative class to leave their cells for multiple hours a day and to partake in congregate activities. Under <em>Bivens</em>, the plaintiff sued for individual damages to compensate for the violation of his constitutional rights and the suffering of physical and emotional injuries. The plaintiff also sued for his costs and attorneys&rsquo; fees.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 17, 2023, the court stayed the case for 21 days pending screening of the complaint. On March 27, 2023, the court issued a brief order finding that the plaintiff had made out viable Eighth Amendment claims for money damages against the defendants in their individual capacities and for injunctive and declaratory relief against the defendants in their official capacities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 4, 2023, the case was reassigned to District Judge Matthew P.

At the time of filing, USP Terre Haute operated the sole federal Bureau of Prisons unit exclusively housing federally sentenced death row inmates, known as the Special Confinement Unit. Inmates in this unit were permitted to leave their single cells only a few hours weekly, generally without congregate interactions.\n\nOn January 12, 2023, a plaintiff incarcerated in the Special Confinement Unit filed a putative class action suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The suit named the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (official capacity), the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the Warden of USP Terre Haute (official and individual capacities), a previous Warden of USP Terre Haute (individual capacity), and USP Terre Haute as defendants. Represented by the ACLU and private counsel, the plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, and attorneys&rsquo; fees. The case was initially assigned to District Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson.\n\nThe plaintiff alleged that the solitary confinement conditions in the Special Confinement Unit violated the Eighth Amendment. According to the complaint, inmates were generally confined at all times to their cells, which were equipped with a table, stool, metal sink, toilet, shower, and a non-opening slit-like window. Inmates with &ldquo;Phase I&rdquo; status were permitted solitary recreation one hour daily, five days a week, in either a small indoor area with exercise equipment or individual outdoor recreation cages with a basketball net. Upon achieving &ldquo;Phase II&rdquo; status, the plaintiff alleged inmates could engage in the recreational hour with one assigned individual. They were also permitted to meet with the assigned individual two days weekly for ninety minutes in a small leisure room with books, hot water, and a television. If an assigned individual refused to participate, recreation or leisure time would be solitary. The plaintiff claimed &ldquo;Phase II&rdquo; recreation and leisure room visits were often canceled and never rescheduled.\n\nThe complaint further stated inmates could leave their cells one hour daily for solitary time in a small room with a computer terminal. Additionally, they occasionally used an area with six cages for religious services, where individuals were individually caged while a religious leader remained outside. A report from the Office of the Inspector General indicated inmates remained in &ldquo;Phase I&rdquo; for at least one year and potentially indefinitely.\n\nThe plaintiff sued on his own behalf and on behalf of a class of &ldquo;all current and future prisoners confined to death row, currently known as the Special Confinement Unit, at the United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute, Indiana.&rdquo; The plaintiff sought declaratory relief for Eighth Amendment violations, injunctive relief under *Ex Parte Young* to allow the plaintiff and putative class to leave their cells for multiple hours daily and partake in congregate activities, and individual damages under *Bivens* for constitutional rights violations and physical and emotional injuries. Costs and attorneys&rsquo; fees were also sought.\n\nThe court stayed the case pending complaint screening. The court subsequently found the plaintiff had made out viable Eighth Amendment claims for money damages against the defendants in their individual capacities and for injunctive and declaratory relief against the defendants in their official capacities.\n\nThe case was later reassigned to District Judge Matthew P. Brookman, possibly for workload reasons.\n\nAs of April 13, 2023, this case was ongoing.",

The suit specifically targets conditions within USP Terre Haute's Special Confinement Unit, which, at the time of filing, operated as the sole federal Bureau of Prisons unit exclusively housing federally sentenced death row inmates. Inmates in this unit were permitted limited out-of-cell time, generally without congregate interactions.\n\nOn January 12, 2023, an incarcerated plaintiff initiated a putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The complaint named the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (official capacity), the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the Warden of USP Terre Haute (official and individual capacities), a previous Warden (individual capacity), and USP Terre Haute as defendants. Represented by the ACLU and private counsel, the plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, and attorneys&rsquo; fees. The case was initially assigned to District Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson.\n\nThe complaint alleged Eighth Amendment violations due to the Special Confinement Unit's solitary confinement conditions. Inmates were generally confined to cells equipped with a table, stool, metal sink, toilet, shower, and a non-opening slit-like window. &ldquo;Phase I&rdquo; status permitted one hour daily, five days a week, of solitary recreation in either a small indoor area with exercise equipment or individual outdoor recreation cages with a basketball net. &ldquo;Phase II&rdquo; status allowed for recreational hours with one assigned individual and two weekly ninety-minute leisure room visits with that individual, though solitary recreation or leisure was mandated if the assigned individual refused. The plaintiff further claimed &ldquo;Phase II&rdquo; recreation and leisure room visits were frequently canceled and unrescheduled.\n\nThe complaint also detailed one hour daily for solitary computer terminal access and occasional use of a six-cage area for religious services, where inmates were individually caged while a religious leader remained outside. An Office of the Inspector General report indicated &ldquo;Phase I&rdquo; status could persist for at least one year and indefinitely.\n\nThe plaintiff brought suit on his own behalf and for a putative class defined as &ldquo;all current and future prisoners confined to death row, currently known as the Special Confinement Unit, at the United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute, Indiana.&rdquo; Relief sought included declaratory judgment for Eighth Amendment violations, injunctive relief under *Ex Parte Young* to permit increased out-of-cell time and congregate activities for the plaintiff and class, and individual damages under *Bivens* for constitutional rights violations and resulting physical and emotional injuries. Costs and attorneys&rsquo; fees were also requested.\n\nFollowing a stay for complaint screening, the court found the plaintiff had asserted viable Eighth Amendment claims for money damages against defendants in their individual capacities and for injunctive and declaratory relief against defendants in their official capacities.\n\nThe case was subsequently reassigned to District Judge Matthew P. Brookman. As of April 13, 2023, this case was ongoing.",

              "transformed_text": "This lawsuit challenges the solitary confinement conditions for people on death row at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. When the suit began, this prison was the only unit in the U.S. Bureau of Prisons that held only men sentenced to death by federal courts. This unit, called the Special Confinement Unit, allowed prisoners to leave their individual cells for only a few hours each week. Even then, they were generally not allowed to interact with other prisoners.\n\nOn January 12, 2023, one prisoner from the Special Confinement Unit filed a proposed class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. He sued the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (in her official role); the Federal Bureau of Prisons; the current Warden of the Terre Haute prison (in both his official and personal roles); a previous Warden (in his personal role); and the Terre Haute prison itself. The prisoner, represented by the ACLU and private lawyers, asked the court to declare the conditions illegal, order changes, award money for harm, and cover legal fees. District Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson was assigned to the case.\n\nThe plaintiff claimed that the solitary confinement conditions in the Special Confinement Unit violated the Constitution's Eighth Amendment, which protects against cruel and unusual punishment. The lawsuit stated that prisoners in the Special Confinement Unit were usually kept in their cells around the clock. These cells had a table, stool, metal sink, toilet, shower, and a narrow, unopenable window. Prisoners with \"Phase I\" status were allowed out for solitary exercise one hour a day, five days a week, either in a small indoor gym or individual outdoor cages with a basketball hoop. In \"Phase II\" status, the plaintiff alleged prisoners could spend their one hour of recreation with one other assigned person. They could also meet with that person twice a week for 90 minutes in a small leisure room with books, hot water, and a TV. If the assigned person refused to go, the prisoner would have solitary recreation or go to the leisure room alone. The plaintiff claimed that recreation and leisure room visits for \"Phase II\" prisoners were often canceled and not rescheduled.\n\nThe complaint also stated that prisoners were allowed out of their cells for one hour a day for solitary time in a small room with a computer. They could also sometimes use another area with six cages for religious services, where prisoners were locked into individual cages while a religious leader stayed outside. A report from the Office of the Inspector General noted that prisoners stayed in \"Phase I\" for at least one year, and sometimes for an unlimited time.\n\nThe plaintiff sued for himself and on behalf of a group (a class) of \"all current and future prisoners on death row, in the Special Confinement Unit, at the Terre Haute federal prison.\" He asked the court to declare that the defendants violated the Eighth Amendment. He also sued under a legal principle called *Ex Parte Young* for an order (injunctive relief) that would let him and the proposed class leave their cells for more hours each day and participate in group activities. Using another legal principle, *Bivens*, the plaintiff sought individual money damages to make up for the violation of his constitutional rights and for his physical and emotional suffering. He also asked for his court costs and legal fees.\n\nOn March 17, 2023, the court paused the case for 21 days to review the complaint. On March 27, 2023, the court issued a short order. It found that the plaintiff had presented strong enough claims under the Eighth Amendment to seek money damages from the defendants in their personal roles, and to seek orders for changes (injunctive and declaratory relief) from them in their official roles.\n\nOn April 4, 2023, the case was assigned to a different judge, District Judge Matthew P. Brookman, likely due to managing court cases.\n\nAs of April 13, 2023, this case was ongoing.",

              "transformed_text": "This lawsuit challenges the solitary confinement conditions for people on death row at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. When the suit began, this prison was the only unit in the federal prison system that held only men sentenced to death by federal courts. This unit, called the Special Confinement Unit, allowed prisoners to leave their individual cells for only a few hours each week. Even then, they were generally not allowed to interact with other inmates.\n\nOn January 12, 2023, one prisoner from the Special Confinement Unit filed a lawsuit, seeking to represent a group of inmates (a class action), in a federal court in Southern Indiana. He sued the head of the federal prison system (acting in her official capacity, meaning as a representative of the government); the Federal Bureau of Prisons; the current warden of the Terre Haute prison (sued both in his official capacity as a government representative and as an individual); a previous warden (sued as an individual); and the Terre Haute prison itself. The prisoner, represented by the ACLU and private attorneys, asked the court to rule the conditions illegal, order changes, award money for the harm caused, and cover their legal costs. District Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson was assigned to the case.\n\nThe prisoner claimed that the solitary confinement conditions in the Special Confinement Unit broke the Constitution's Eighth Amendment, which protects people from cruel and unusual punishment. The lawsuit said inmates in the Special Confinement Unit were usually confined to their cells 24 hours a day. These cells had a table, stool, metal sink, toilet, shower, and a narrow, unopenable window. In \"Phase I,\" prisoners could leave their cells for one hour of solitary exercise each day, five days a week. This was either in a small indoor gym or individual outdoor cages with a basketball hoop. In \"Phase II,\" the prisoner claimed inmates could spend their one hour of recreation with one other assigned person. They could also meet that person twice a week for 90 minutes in a small leisure room with books, hot water, and a TV. If the assigned person didn't go, the prisoner would have to do recreation alone or go to the leisure room by themselves. The lawsuit stated that these recreation and leisure room visits for \"Phase II\" prisoners were often canceled and never rescheduled.\n\nThe complaint also said prisoners could leave their cells for one hour a day to use a computer in a small room, but still alone. They could also sometimes use an area with six cages for religious services. Inmates were locked into separate cages while a religious leader remained outside. A report from the government's Office of the Inspector General showed that prisoners stayed in \"Phase I\" for at least a year, and sometimes for an unlimited time.\n\nThe prisoner sued on his own behalf and for a group of \"all current and future prisoners on death row, in the Special Confinement Unit, at the Terre Haute federal prison.\" He asked the court to rule that the defendants had violated the Eighth Amendment. He also used a legal rule called *Ex Parte Young*, which allows people to sue government officials to stop them from doing something illegal or unconstitutional, to ask for a court order (called an injunction) that would allow him and the group of inmates to leave their cells for more hours each day and take part in group activities. Using another legal rule known as *Bivens*, which allows people to sue federal officials for money if their constitutional rights were violated, the prisoner sought money (called damages) for himself to make up for his constitutional rights being violated and for his physical and emotional suffering. He also asked for his court costs and legal fees.\n\nOn March 17, 2023, the court temporarily stopped the case for 21 days to review the lawsuit. On March 27, 2023, the court issued a brief order. It ruled that the prisoner had presented strong enough claims under the Eighth Amendment to seek money from the defendants as individuals, and to seek court orders for changes (like injunctions, which are orders to do or stop doing something, and declarations, which are court rulings clarifying rights) from them in their official capacities as government representatives.\n\nOn April 4, 2023, the case was assigned to a different judge, District Judge Matthew P. Brookman, likely to balance the court's workload.\n\nAs of April 13, 2023, this case was ongoing.",

              "transformed_text": "A lawsuit was filed. It was about how prisoners on death row were kept. They were held alone in cells. This was at a federal prison in Indiana. When the case started, this prison was special. It was the only federal prison that held only men sentenced to death by the government.\n\nThis part of the prison was called the Special Confinement Unit. Prisoners could leave their cells for only a few hours a week. Even then, they usually had to be alone. They could not be with other prisoners.\n\nOn January 12, 2023, one prisoner from this unit started a lawsuit. He wanted to help himself and many other prisoners. He filed it in a federal court in Indiana. He sued many people. He sued the main boss of all federal prisons. He sued the Federal Bureau of Prisons. He sued the current boss of the Terre Haute prison. He sued a past boss of that prison. He also sued the Terre Haute prison itself. He sued some of them as their job, and some as themselves.\n\nThe prisoner got help from the ACLU and other lawyers. He asked the court to say the prison conditions were wrong. He wanted the court to make the prison change things. He also wanted money for the problems he faced. And he wanted his legal bills paid. A judge named Jane Magnus-Stinson was given the case.\n\nThe prisoner said being held alone in the Special Confinement Unit was against the law. He said it broke the Eighth Amendment. This part of the Constitution stops cruel and unusual punishment. The lawsuit said prisoners in this unit were usually in their cells all day and night. Their cells had a table, a seat, a metal sink, a toilet, and a shower. They also had a small window that could not open.\n\nIn \"Phase I,\" prisoners could leave their cells for one hour. This was for exercise. They did this alone. They could do it five days a week. They exercised in a small indoor room or in outdoor cages. The cages had a basketball hoop. In \"Phase II,\" the prisoner said they could spend their one hour of free time with another prisoner. They could also meet that person two times a week. This was for 90 minutes. They met in a small room with books, hot water, and a TV. If the other prisoner didn't show up, they had to be alone. The lawsuit said these free time visits for \"Phase II\" prisoners were often called off. And they were never set up again.\n\nThe lawsuit also said prisoners could leave their cells for one hour a day. This was to use a computer in a small room. But they were still alone. Sometimes, they could use another area for church services. It had six cages. Prisoners were locked in their own cages. A religious leader stayed outside the cages. A government report showed that prisoners stayed in \"Phase I\" for at least a year. Sometimes, they stayed there forever.\n\nThe prisoner sued for himself. He also sued for all other prisoners on death row in that unit. This included those there now and those who would be there later. He asked the court to say that the people he sued had broken the Eighth Amendment. He used a special rule called *Ex Parte Young*. This rule lets people sue government workers. It helps stop them from doing things that are against the law. He asked the court to order changes. He wanted himself and other prisoners to leave their cells more often. He wanted them to do things together in groups.\n\nHe also used another rule called *Bivens*. This rule lets people sue federal workers for money. This happens if their rights under the Constitution are broken. The prisoner wanted money for himself. This money would help him for the harm and pain he felt. He also asked for his court bills and lawyer fees to be paid.\n\nOn March 17, 2023, the court paused the case for 21 days. It wanted to look closely at the lawsuit. On March 27, 2023, the court made a short decision. The court said the prisoner had good reasons to sue. He could ask for money from the people he sued. He could also ask the court to order changes. These orders would make the government workers change things.\n\nOn April 4, 2023, a new judge was given the case. His name was Matthew P. Brookman. This was probably to help share the work. As of April 13, 2023, the case was still happening.",

When this suit was filed, the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute operated the only unit in the United States Bureau of Prisons that exclusively held men sentenced to death by federal courts. Referred to as the Special Confinement Unit, individuals incarcerated in the unit were only permitted to leave their single cells a few hours each week. Even when allowed to leave, they were generally denied congregate interactions.</p>\r\n<p>On January 12, 2023, one individual imprisoned in the Special Confinement Unit filed a putative class action suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana against the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons in her official capacity; the Federal Bureau of Prisons; the Warden of the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana in his official and individual capacity; a previous Warden of the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana in his individual capacity; and the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute. Represented by the ACLU and private counsel, the plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, and attorneys&rsquo; fees. The case was assigned to District Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff alleged that the solitary confinement conditions in the Special Confinement Unit violated the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution. According to the complaint, individuals incarcerated in the Special Confinement Unit were generally confined at all times to their cells, which contained a table, a stool, a metal sink, a toilet unit, a shower, and a slit-like window they could not open. Individuals with &ldquo;Phase I&rdquo; status were permitted to leave their cells for solitary recreation one hour a day for five days a week in either a small indoor area with exercise equipment or in individual outdoor recreation cages with a basketball net. When granted &ldquo;Phase II&rdquo; status, the plaintiff alleged they were permitted to engage in the one recreational hour with one other assigned individual. They were also permitted to meet with the assigned individual two days a week for ninety minutes in a small leisure room with books, hot water, and a television. If one&rsquo;s assigned individual refused to go to the recreation or leisure room, one would have solitary recreation or go to the leisure room alone. The plaintiff claimed that recreation and leisure room visits for individuals in &ldquo;Phase II&rdquo; were often canceled and never rescheduled.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>According to the complaint, they were also permitted to leave their cells one hour a day for solitary time in a small room with a computer terminal. Additionally, they could occasionally use another area with six cages for religious services, with the incarcerated individuals locked into each cage individually while a religious leader remained outside of the cages. According to a <a href=\"https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2017/e1705.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> from the Office of the Inspector General, individuals incarcerated remained in &ldquo;Phase I&rdquo; for at least one year and up to an indefinite period of time.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff sued on his own behalf and on behalf of a class of &ldquo;all current and future prisoners confined to death row, currently known as the Special Confinement Unit, at the United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute, Indiana.&rdquo; The plaintiff sued for declaratory relief that the defendants violated the Eighth Amendment. The plaintiff also sued under <em>Ex Parte Young</em> for injunctive relief that would allow the plaintiff and the putative class to leave their cells for multiple hours a day and to partake in congregate activities. Under <em>Bivens</em>, the plaintiff sued for individual damages to compensate for the violation of his constitutional rights and the suffering of physical and emotional injuries. The plaintiff also sued for his costs and attorneys&rsquo; fees.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 17, 2023, the court stayed the case for 21 days pending screening of the complaint.

              "transformed_text": "The historical record reveals a profound challenge to the conditions of solitary confinement for individuals on federal death row, specifically within the United States Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana. This facility, operating the nation's sole unit for men sentenced to death by federal courts—known as the Special Confinement Unit—imposed conditions where prisoners were rarely permitted to leave their single cells and were largely denied any congregate interaction.\n\nOn January 12, 2023, a prisoner from this unit initiated a putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The strategic purpose of this filing was to seek a declaration that the conditions violated the Eighth Amendment, to compel changes through injunctive relief, and to secure compensation for the suffering endured. The lawsuit targeted key figures responsible for the unit's operation, including the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons in her official capacity, the Federal Bureau of Prisons itself, the Warden of USP Terre Haute in both official and individual capacities, a former Warden in his individual capacity, and the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute. Represented by the ACLU and private counsel, the plaintiff aimed not only to address his own plight but to represent all current and future prisoners confined to death row at the facility.\n\nThe complaint laid bare the daily existence within the Special Confinement Unit, detailing how individuals were confined almost constantly to their cells, equipped with basic, unyielding fixtures and a sealed window. The plaintiff described a system of \"Phase I\" and \"Phase II\" statuses, which, even at their most lenient, offered only limited, often solitary, recreation or heavily restricted interactions. The strategic intent behind these detailed allegations was to paint a clear picture of the alleged cruel and unusual punishment, demonstrating how the conditions deprived individuals of meaningful human contact and activity, often leading to canceled and unrescheduled opportunities for even limited engagement. An earlier report from the Office of the Inspector General had already highlighted that inmates could remain in \"Phase I\" for indefinite periods, further underscoring the systemic nature of the challenge.\n\nTo achieve the desired systemic changes and individual redress, the plaintiff strategically invoked specific legal doctrines. Declaratory relief was sought to formally establish the Eighth Amendment violation. For injunctive relief, aimed at allowing prisoners more time out of their cells and opportunities for congregate activities, the plaintiff proceeded under *Ex Parte Young*, a doctrine allowing suits against state officials to prevent ongoing constitutional violations. For individual damages to compensate for the violation of his constitutional rights and the suffering of physical and emotional injuries, the plaintiff pursued claims under *Bivens*, which permits lawsuits against federal officials for constitutional violations.\n\nThe court's initial engagement with the case began on March 17, 2023, with a 21-day stay, a standard procedural pause to allow for the screening of the complaint. This preliminary review was a critical step, and on March 27, 2023, the court issued an order that served as an early validation of the lawsuit's potential merits. This finding indicated that the plaintiff had presented viable Eighth Amendment claims for money damages against the officials in their individual capacities and for injunctive and declaratory relief against the defendants in their official capacities, signaling that the case would proceed. The case was subsequently reassigned to District Judge Matthew P. Brookman on April 4, 2023, likely for workload management. As of April 13, 2023, this significant legal and historical challenge remained ongoing.",

It's a life of profound isolation, where basic human connection is a distant memory, creating an existence of severe deprivation.\n\nOne man, enduring these harsh conditions, decided he could not stay silent. He spoke up, not just for himself, but for all the others trapped in this extreme isolation. He turned to the legal system for help, arguing that such a life of profound deprivation was fundamentally wrong. His plea was heard, and the courts agreed that his concerns were serious enough to proceed against the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the Bureau itself, the current and a former Warden of the Terre Haute prison, and the prison itself. He sought to force them to change these harsh policies, allowing more time out of cells and opportunities for shared activities, and to provide compensation for the profound suffering they had caused.\n\nThis means that the fundamental question of whether these extreme conditions amount to cruel and unusual treatment will finally be explored in depth. The court's initial decision to allow claims for financial compensation from the individuals responsible, and to demand mandatory changes to the prison's policies, marks a crucial step toward bringing an end to the severe isolation faced by these men.",

        "summary": "<p>On August 3, 2015, two minor children with disabilities filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky. The plaintiffs sued the Kenton County Sheriff's Office, the Sheriff for Kenton County (in only his official capacity), and the Sheriff's Office's School Resource Officer (in his official and individual capacities) under 42 U.S.C § 1983 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and private counsel, sought injunctive relief, declaratory relief and damages, claiming the defendant used unnecessary and excessive physical restraint and handcuffs on schoolchildren with disabilities. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants' actions constituted unreasonable seizure and excessive force in violation of plaintiffs' rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The plaintiffs also claimed that the defendants discriminated against the plaintiffs based on their disabilities and failed to accommodate their disabilities.  </p><p>On September 9, 2015, the defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. On September 30, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a cross motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p><p>On December 28, 2015, Judge William O. Bertelsman denied the defendants' motion to dismiss without prejudice. The Court found that the plaintiffs adequately pleaded a constitutional violation in order to make out a § 1983 claim. The plaintiffs also adequately pleaded plausible claims for discrimination under Title II. </p><p>In October 2016, both parties filed cross motions for partial summary judgment. Additionally, the defendants filed a motion to sever the claims of the two students on September 14, 2017. Judge Bertelsman denied the defendants' motion to sever because of the substantial factual similarities between the two handcuffing situations and the existence of a common question of law: whether the elbow-cuffing of these children was unconstitutional. </p><p>On October 11, 2017, Judge Bertelsman ruled on the parties' cross motions for partial summary judgment. Judge Bertelsman held for the plaintiffs on their claims of unlawful seizure and excessive use of force and municipal liability against Kenton County for those violations. The Court applied the Graham factors and found that although the severity of the crime weighed in favor of the defendants, the other factors -- whether the children posed an immediate threat to themselves or others; the age and stature of the children; and the method of handcuffing -- weighed in favor of the plaintiffs. </p><p>However, Judge Bertelsman ruled against the plaintiffs on their ADA discrimination and reasonable accommodation claims. The Court found that no reasonable jury could find that the defendants' handcuffing of the plaintiffs would not have occurred \"but</p><p>for\" their alleged disabilities, as opposed to their behavior on the days in question. </p><p>Additionally, Judge Bertelsman held for the defendants on the issue of qualified immunity. Although the Court said it was a close call, it found that the plaintiffs failed to show that it was clearly established that the handcuffing was unconstitutional. The Court found that the Supreme Court precedent that the plaintiffs relied on was too generalized and that the plaintiffs failed to cite to any Sixth Circuit precedent. </p><p>On February 7, 2018, the defendants (in their official capacities) filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' constitutional claims under § 1983 for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, claiming state sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. Before hearing oral argument on the issue of damages, the Court noted that it would take the defendants' motion to dismiss under advisement. </p><p>However, following a settlement conference on April 13, 2018, the parties privately reached an agreement whereby the defendants agreed to pay more than $337,000 in damages. The Court dismissed the action with prejudice on November 1, 2018, ordering that each party must pay their own costs.</p><p></p>",

Applying the Graham factors, the Court found factors such as immediate threat, age, stature, and handcuffing method weighed in plaintiffs' favor.\n*   Conversely, the Court ruled against plaintiffs on their ADA discrimination and reasonable accommodation claims, finding no reasonable jury could conclude the handcuffing would not have occurred \"but for\" their alleged disabilities. Defendants also prevailed on qualified immunity, as plaintiffs failed to demonstrate the unconstitutionality of the handcuffing was clearly established by generalized Supreme Court or Sixth Circuit precedent.\n*   Following a settlement conference, the parties reached a private agreement for defendants to pay over $337,000 in damages.

The plaintiffs sued the Kenton County Sheriff's Office, the Sheriff for Kenton County (in only his official capacity), and the Sheriff's Office's School Resource Officer (in his official and individual capacities) under 42 U.S.C § 1983 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and private counsel, sought injunctive relief, declaratory relief and damages, claiming the defendant used unnecessary and excessive physical restraint and handcuffs on schoolchildren with disabilities. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants' actions constituted unreasonable seizure and excessive force in violation of plaintiffs' rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The plaintiffs also claimed that the defendants discriminated against the plaintiffs based on their disabilities and failed to accommodate their disabilities.  </p><p>On September 9, 2015, the defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. On September 30, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a cross motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p><p>On December 28, 2015, Judge William O. Bertelsman denied the defendants' motion to dismiss without prejudice. The Court found that the plaintiffs adequately pleaded a constitutional violation in order to make out a § 1983 claim. The plaintiffs also adequately pleaded plausible claims for discrimination under Title II. </p><p>In October 2016, both parties filed cross motions for partial summary judgment. Additionally, the defendants filed a motion to sever the claims of the two students on September 14, 2017. Judge Bertelsman denied the defendants' motion to sever because of the substantial factual similarities between the two handcuffing situations and the existence of a common question of law: whether the elbow-cuffing of these children was unconstitutional. </p><p>On October 11, 2017, Judge Bertelsman ruled on the parties' cross motions for partial summary judgment. Judge Bertelsman held for the plaintiffs on their claims of unlawful seizure and excessive use of force and municipal liability against Kenton County for those violations. The Court applied the Graham factors and found that although the severity of the crime weighed in favor of the defendants, the other factors -- whether the children posed an immediate threat to themselves or others; the age and stature of the children; and the method of handcuffing -- weighed in favor of the plaintiffs. </p><p>However, Judge Bertelsman ruled against the plaintiffs on their ADA discrimination and reasonable accommodation claims. The Court found that no reasonable jury could find that the defendants' handcuffing of the plaintiffs would not have occurred \"but</p><p>for\" their alleged disabilities, as opposed to their behavior on the days in question. </p><p>Additionally, Judge Bertelsman held for the defendants on the issue of qualified immunity. Although the Court said it was a close call, it found that the plaintiffs failed to show that it was clearly established that the handcuffing was unconstitutional. The Court found that the Supreme Court precedent that the plaintiffs relied on was too generalized and that the plaintiffs failed to cite to any Sixth Circuit precedent. </p><p>On February 7, 2018, the defendants (in their official capacities) filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' constitutional claims under § 1983 for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, claiming state sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. Before hearing oral argument on the issue of damages, the Court noted that it would take the defendants' motion to dismiss under advisement. </p><p>However, following a settlement conference on April 13, 2018, the parties privately reached an agreement whereby the defendants agreed to pay more than $337,000 in damages. The Court dismissed the action with prejudice on November 1, 2018, ordering that each party must pay their own costs.</p><p></p>",

Even though the judge called it a tough decision, he found that the children could not prove that the law was already clear that this specific type of handcuffing was against the Constitution.

              "transformed_text": "On August 3, 2015, two students with disabilities sued in federal court in Kentucky. These students sued the local Sheriff's Office, the Sheriff himself (acting in his job), and a School Resource Officer (both in his job and as an individual). They claimed their rights were violated under a federal law that protects people's civil rights, and also under a disability rights law called the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The students, with help from groups like the ACLU and private lawyers, asked the court to make the Sheriff's Office stop these actions, officially state that their rights were violated, and pay them money for the harm they suffered. They said the defendants used too much physical force and handcuffs on students, especially those with disabilities. The students argued this was like an illegal arrest and too much force, meaning the police held them unfairly and used more force than necessary. This, they argued, went against their rights under the U.S. Constitution, which protects people from such actions. They also claimed they were treated unfairly because of their disabilities and weren't given the help or changes they needed (what lawyers call 'reasonable accommodations').\n\nA month later, on September 9, 2015, the Sheriff's Office and the other defendants asked the judge to throw out the case, saying the lawsuit didn't have enough facts to prove a legal problem. Soon after, on September 30, 2015, the students filed their own request, asking the judge to rule in their favor just based on the written arguments, without a full trial.\n\nOn December 28, 2015, Judge William O. Bertelsman said 'no' to the defendants' request to dismiss the case. The judge decided the students had shared enough information to show that their constitutional rights might have been violated under that federal civil rights law. And, they had enough facts to make believable claims of discrimination under the ADA.\n\nIn October 2016, both sides asked the judge to make a decision on *some* parts of the case without going through a whole trial. Also, in September 2017, the defendants asked to separate the cases of the two students, treating them as completely different lawsuits. But Judge Bertelsman said no. He explained that both handcuffing incidents were very similar and raised the same big question: was putting elbow-cuffs on these children against the law?\n\nOn October 11, 2017, Judge Bertelsman made his decision on those requests for partial judgment. He sided with the students, agreeing that the handcuffing was an illegal arrest and used too much force. He also said that Kenton County, as a government body, was responsible for these actions. The court looked at several important factors. For example, while the seriousness of what the students were accused of might have helped the defendants' argument, other key things favored the students: like whether they were an immediate danger to anyone, their age and size, and *how* they were handcuffed.\n\nBut, Judge Bertelsman ruled against the students on their claims that they were discriminated against because of their disabilities or weren't given reasonable accommodations. The judge felt that no fair jury would conclude that the defendants handcuffed the children *because* they had disabilities. Instead, he believed it was because of how the children behaved on those particular days.\n\nAlso, Judge Bertelsman sided with the defendants on something called 'qualified immunity.' Think of this as a special shield that protects government officials from certain lawsuits, unless their actions clearly violated a well-known law. Even though the judge said it was a tough call, he found that the students couldn't prove that the law was already *so clear* that this specific way of handcuffing was definitely against the Constitution. He explained that the Supreme Court cases the students relied on were too general. They didn't point to any specific rulings from the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is the higher court that oversees Kentucky and its legal decisions.\n\nOn February 7, 2018, the defendants (acting in their official jobs) again asked the court to dismiss the students' claims about their constitutional rights. They argued the court couldn't even hear these claims because of something called 'state sovereign immunity.' This is like a rule from the Constitution's Eleventh Amendment that says states are protected from certain lawsuits. Before a hearing to decide how much money the students should receive, the judge said he would consider the defendants' request to dismiss.\n\nHowever, after a meeting to try and settle the case on April 13, 2018, both sides privately agreed that the defendants would pay the students over $337,000 to resolve the case. The court officially closed the case for good on November 1, 2018, with each side responsible for paying their own legal costs.",

The plaintiffs sued the Kenton County Sheriff's Office, the Sheriff for Kenton County (in only his official capacity), and the Sheriff's Office's School Resource Officer (in his official and individual capacities) under 42 U.S.C § 1983 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and private counsel, sought injunctive relief, declaratory relief and damages, claiming the defendant used unnecessary and excessive physical restraint and handcuffs on schoolchildren with disabilities. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants' actions constituted unreasonable seizure and excessive force in violation of plaintiffs' rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The plaintiffs also claimed that the defendants discriminated against the plaintiffs based on their disabilities and failed to accommodate their disabilities.  </p><p>On September 9, 2015, the defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. On September 30, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a cross motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p><p>On December 28, 2015, Judge William O. Bertelsman denied the defendants' motion to dismiss without prejudice. The Court found that the plaintiffs adequately pleaded a constitutional violation in order to make out a § 1983 claim. The plaintiffs also adequately pleaded plausible claims for discrimination under Title II. </p><p>In October 2016, both parties filed cross motions for partial summary judgment. Additionally, the defendants filed a motion to sever the claims of the two students on September 14, 2017. Judge Bertelsman denied the defendants' motion to sever because of the substantial factual similarities between the two handcuffing situations and the existence of a common question of law: whether the elbow-cuffing of these children was unconstitutional. </p><p>On October 11, 2017, Judge Bertelsman ruled on the parties' cross motions for partial summary judgment. Judge Bertelsman held for the plaintiffs on their claims of unlawful seizure and excessive use of force and municipal liability against Kenton County for those violations. The Court applied the Graham factors and found that although the severity of the crime weighed in favor of the defendants, the other factors -- whether the children posed an immediate threat to themselves or others; the age and stature of the children; and the method of handcuffing -- weighed in favor of the plaintiffs. </p><p>However, Judge Bertelsman ruled against the plaintiffs on their ADA discrimination and reasonable accommodation claims. The Court found that no reasonable jury could find that the defendants' handcuffing of the plaintiffs would not have occurred \"but</p><p>for\" their alleged disabilities, as opposed to their behavior on the days in question. </p><p>Additionally, Judge Bertelsman held for the defendants on the issue of qualified immunity. Although the Court said it was a close call, it found that the plaintiffs failed to show that it was clearly established that the handcuffing was unconstitutional.

              "transformed_text": "In August 2015, a significant legal battle began when two minor children with disabilities sought justice in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky. They initiated a lawsuit against the Kenton County Sheriff's Office, the Sheriff, and a School Resource Officer, driven by claims that they had endured unnecessary and excessive physical restraint, including handcuffing, at school. Their core argument was that these actions violated their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights through unreasonable seizure and excessive force, and constituted discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Through this legal challenge, the children, supported by the ACLU, aimed to secure injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and damages, hoping to halt such practices and gain recompense for their experiences.\n\nThe defendants quickly responded in September 2015 by filing a motion to dismiss the case. Their strategic objective was to end the lawsuit at its earliest stage, arguing that even if the plaintiffs' allegations were true, they did not amount to legally recognizable claims. In response, the plaintiffs filed their own cross motion, seeking an early judgment in their favor, believing the pleadings alone demonstrated their entitlement to relief.\n\nHowever, in December 2015, Judge William O. Bertelsman denied the defendants' attempt to dismiss the case. The Court found that the children had indeed presented a plausible narrative of constitutional violations and discrimination, allowing their claims to proceed and requiring the defendants to answer the allegations more fully.\n\nAs the case matured, both sides sought to resolve parts of the dispute without a full trial. In October 2016, they filed cross motions for partial summary judgment, each hoping to secure a definitive ruling on certain claims based on the evidence gathered. The defendants also attempted, in September 2017, to sever the claims of the two students, likely hoping to treat their experiences as isolated incidents rather than a pattern. Yet, Judge Bertelsman denied this motion, recognizing the substantial factual similarities between the two handcuffing situations and the common legal question of whether such \"elbow-cuffing\" was unconstitutional, thus keeping the plaintiffs' unified narrative intact.\n\nIn October 2017, Judge Bertelsman delivered a significant ruling on the summary judgment motions. He sided with the plaintiffs on their core claims of unlawful seizure and excessive force, holding Kenton County liable for these constitutional violations. The judge's analysis, applying established legal factors, found that despite the severity of the children's initial behavior, their age, stature, and the method of handcuffing strongly supported the plaintiffs' case. However, the judge ruled against the plaintiffs on their ADA discrimination claims, concluding that the handcuffing was more likely a response to their behavior than a direct result of their disabilities. Furthermore, the judge granted qualified immunity to the individual officer, determining that while the handcuffing was unconstitutional, it was not *clearly established* as such by prior legal precedent at the time, thus shielding the officer from personal liability.\n\nDespite these partial rulings, the defendants made another attempt in February 2018 to dismiss the constitutional claims, asserting state sovereign immunity to avoid paying damages. This final procedural challenge aimed to prevent any financial award.\n\nUltimately, the parties chose to resolve the long-running dispute through negotiation. Following a settlement conference in April 2018, they reached a private agreement where the defendants consented to pay over $337,000 in damages. This settlement, which led to the case's dismissal in November 2018, brought a definitive end to the legal struggle, providing the plaintiffs with substantial compensation and concluding a notable chapter in the history of disability rights and law enforcement practices in schools.",

              "transformed_text": "The central legal question in this case was whether law enforcement's use of physical restraints, specifically handcuffing, on minor children with disabilities within a school setting violated their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights against unreasonable seizure and excessive force, or constituted discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act. After the children initiated their lawsuit in federal court, the parties filed cross-motions for dismissal and later for summary judgment, while the defendants also sought to sever the students' claims.\n\nInitially, the court allowed the case to proceed, finding the children's allegations of constitutional violations and discrimination plausible. Crucially, the court denied the defendants' attempt to sever the claims, recognizing the substantial factual similarities in the handcuffing incidents and the common legal question of whether such \"elbow-cuffing\" was unconstitutional. In a significant ruling on summary judgment, the court sided with the plaintiffs on their core claims of unlawful seizure and excessive force, holding Kenton County liable for these constitutional violations. The judge's analysis found that despite the severity of the children's initial behavior, their age, stature, and the specific method of handcuffing strongly supported the plaintiffs' case. However, the court ruled against the plaintiffs on their ADA discrimination claims, concluding that the handcuffing was more likely a response to the children's behavior than a direct result of their disabilities. Furthermore, the individual officer was granted qualified immunity, as the court determined that while the handcuffing was unconstitutional, it was not *clearly established* as such by prior legal precedent at the time, shielding the officer from personal liability. Ultimately, rather than proceeding to trial, the parties resolved the dispute through negotiation, reaching a private settlement where the defendants agreed to pay over $337,000 in damages, bringing the case to a definitive close.",

The parents sued the school district and various officials, administrators, and teachers in their official capacity under 42 U.S.C. 1983.

In 2012, the Massachusetts Board of Elementary and Secondary Education published guidance for school districts when faced with the instant issue. While the guidance has never been adopted as legally binding or as such to have substantive effect, the plaintiffs rely on the Board&rsquo;s suggestion for how individual school districts should handle informing parents of their children&rsquo;s gender identity crisis.

On April 12, 2022, two sets of parents, represented by public interest attorneys, initiated an action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. They sued the school district and various officials, administrators, and teachers in their official capacity under 42 U.S.C. 1983, seeking declarations that the policy was unconstitutional, an injunction against its adherence, nominal and compensatory damages, and attorneys’ fees.\n\nPlaintiffs contended that a school district may not empower teachers to assist students with gender identity transitions or to conceal such matters from parents, whether deliberately or accidentally. They relied on 2012 Massachusetts Board of Elementary and Secondary Education guidance, arguing it should govern in the absence of a contrary local policy, despite its non-binding status.\n\nDefendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. They asserted plaintiffs lacked Article III standing, arguing they failed to allege their children were transgender or had interacted with defendants, thus failing the cause or controversy, traceability, and relief requirements. Defendants also invoked qualified immunity.\n\nOn December 14, 2022, District Judge Mark Mastroianni granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss for lack of standing. The court alternatively noted that the complaint's allegations would not have overcome the school district’s qualified immunity. Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\n\nOn February 18, 2025, the appellate court affirmed the dismissal. The court concluded that plaintiffs failed to present a plausible claim that the school's protocol infringed upon their fundamental due process right “to direct the upbringing of their child.” The court further determined that the “shock-in-conscience” test was inapplicable because the school policy constituted legislative, not executive, conduct, given its broad application to all students and administration by multiple government actors. Consequently, the court assessed whether plaintiffs adequately alleged Ludlow’s conduct restricted a fundamental right, concluding they had not. The case remains ongoing as of February 19, 2025.",

On April 12, 2022, two sets of parents filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The parents sued the school district and various officials, administrators, and teachers in their official capacity under 42 U.S.C. 1983. Represented by public interest attorneys for the Massachusetts Family Institute and Child and Parental Rights Campaign, the parents sought various declarations regarding the policy at issue to be unconstitutional, an injunction against adherence to the policy, nominal damages, compensatory damages, and attorneys&rsquo; fees.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs claimed that a school district may not empower individual teachers to assist students who are in the midst of a crisis of gender identity to transition and in particular to conceal in any manner the student's desire to transition or feelings on the matter from the parents either deliberately or accidentally. In 2012, the Massachusetts Board of Elementary and Secondary Education published guidance for school districts when faced with the instant issue. While the guidance has never been adopted as legally binding or as such to have substantive effect, the plaintiffs rely on the Board&rsquo;s suggestion for how individual school districts should handle informing parents of their children&rsquo;s gender identity crisis. The plaintiffs argued that in the absence of a local school district policy to the contrary, the Board&rsquo;s guidance should govern.</p>\r\n<p>On July 29, 2022, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Defendants argued that plaintiffs lacked Article III standing because they failed to allege that their children were transgender or had interacted with any of the defendants, failing both the cause or controversy requirement, traceability, and claim upon which relief could be granted requirements of standing. Defendants also asserted qualified immunity.</p>\r\n<p>District Judge Mark Mastroianni granted Defendant&rsquo;s motion to dismiss for lack of standing on December 14, 2022, and noted that in the alternative the allegations in the complaint would not have overcome the school district&rsquo;s qualified immunity. 2022 WL 18356421. On January 11, 2023, Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On February 18, 2025, the appellate court upheld the dismissal, concluding that the plaintiffs failed to present a plausible claim that the school's protocol infringed upon their fundamental right under the due process clause &ldquo;to direct the upbringing of their child.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On February 18, 2025, the appellate court upheld the dismissal, concluding that the plaintiffs failed to present a plausible claim that the school's protocol infringed upon their fundamental right under the due process clause &ldquo;to direct the upbringing of their child.&rdquo; The court also noted that the &ldquo;shock-in-conscience&rdquo; test was not the appropriate legal standard to utilize because the school policy was not executive but legislative conduct. The court based this conclusion on the fact that the policy applies broadly to all students and is administered by multiple government actors. Thus, the test they used was whether the plaintiffs had adequately alleged that Ludlow&rsquo;s conduct restricted a fundamental right, which the court concluded it had not.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As of February 19, 2025, the case is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

On April 12, 2022, two sets of parents sued in federal court in Massachusetts. The parents sued the school district and several officials, administrators, and teachers in their roles as school employees, under a federal civil rights law. They were represented by public interest lawyers from the Massachusetts Family Institute and Child and Parental Rights Campaign. The parents asked the court to declare the school's policy unconstitutional, order the school to stop following it, and award them small damages, money for their losses, and legal fees.\n\nThe parents argued that a school district should not allow teachers to help students exploring their gender identity and possibly transitioning, especially by hiding a student's desire to transition or feelings about it from their parents, whether on purpose or by accident. In 2012, the Massachusetts Board of Elementary and Secondary Education released guidelines for schools dealing with this issue. Even though these guidelines were never made legally binding or given real legal power, the parents relied on the Board's suggestion for how schools should tell parents about their children's gender identity exploration. They argued that if a local school district didn't have its own policy, the Board's guidelines should apply.\n\nOn July 29, 2022, the school officials asked the court to throw out the case, arguing that the lawsuit didn't state a valid legal claim. The school officials argued that the parents didn't have the legal right to sue in federal court. They said the parents hadn't claimed that their children were transgender or had even interacted with any of the specific school employees named in the lawsuit. This meant the parents didn't meet the rules for who can sue, including showing a real dispute and that the school caused their harm. The school officials also claimed \"qualified immunity,\" a legal protection for government officials.\n\nOn December 14, 2022, District Judge Mark Mastroianni agreed with the school officials and dismissed the case because the parents lacked the legal right to sue. He also noted that even if the standing issue wasn't there, what the parents claimed in their lawsuit wouldn't have been enough to get past the school district's qualified immunity protection. 2022 WL 18356421. On January 11, 2023, the parents appealed this dismissal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\n\nOn February 18, 2025, the appeals court agreed with the dismissal. It found that the parents failed to make a believable legal argument that the school's policy violated their basic right, protected by the Constitution's \"due process\" clause, to \"direct the upbringing of their child.\"\n\nThe court also said that the \"shock-the-conscience\" test was not the right legal test to use. This was because the school policy was a general rule-making action (legislative), not a specific decision by an official (executive). The court concluded this because the policy applies broadly to all students and is handled by many school employees. So, the test they used was whether the parents had sufficiently claimed that Ludlow's actions limited a basic right, which the court decided they had not.\n\nAs of February 19, 2025, the case is still ongoing.",

They didn't tell parents their children had decided to identify as a different gender at school. On April 12, 2022, two sets of parents sued in federal court in Massachusetts. The parents sued the school district and its staff – officials, administrators, and teachers. They sued them because of their roles as school employees, using a federal civil rights law. Public interest lawyers from the Massachusetts Family Institute and Child and Parental Rights Campaign represented the parents. The parents asked the court to rule the school's policy was unconstitutional. They wanted the court to order the school to stop using it. They also asked for a small amount of money for their losses and to cover their legal fees.\n\nThe parents argued that schools shouldn't allow teachers to help students explore their gender identity or transition. They especially felt teachers should not hide a student's desire to transition or their feelings about it from parents, whether on purpose or by accident. In 2012, the Massachusetts Board of Elementary and Secondary Education released guidelines for schools dealing with this issue. These guidelines were never legally required or given real power. Still, the parents relied on the Board's suggestion for how schools should tell parents about their children's gender identity exploration. They argued that if a local school district didn't have its own policy, the Board's guidelines should apply.\n\nOn July 29, 2022, school officials asked the court to throw out the case. They argued the lawsuit didn't present a valid legal reason to sue. The school officials argued that the parents didn't have the legal right to sue in federal court. They said the parents hadn't claimed their children were transgender. Also, they hadn't claimed their children interacted with any specific school employees named in the lawsuit. This meant the parents didn't meet the legal rules for who can sue. These rules require showing a real disagreement and that the school caused them harm. The school officials also claimed \"qualified immunity,\" a legal protection for government officials.\n\nOn December 14, 2022, District Judge Mark Mastroianni agreed with the school officials. He dismissed the case because the parents lacked the legal right to sue. He also pointed out that even if the parents had the right to sue, their claims in the lawsuit wouldn't have been strong enough. They wouldn't have been able to get past the school district's qualified immunity protection. On January 11, 2023, the parents appealed this dismissal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\n\nOn February 18, 2025, the appeals court agreed with the dismissal. It found that the parents failed to make a believable legal argument. They said the school's policy went against their basic right to \"direct the upbringing of their child.\" This right is protected by the Constitution's \"due process\" clause.\n\nThe court also said that the \"shock-the-conscience\" test wasn't the right legal test to use. This was because the school policy was like a general rule or law for everyone (what we call 'legislative' action). It wasn't a specific decision made by just one official (what we call 'executive' action). The court decided this because the policy applies to all students generally, and many school employees are involved in carrying it out. So, the test the court used was whether the parents had clearly shown that Ludlow's actions limited a basic right. The court decided they had not.\n\nAs of February 19, 2025, the case is still ongoing.",

So, on April 12, 2022, two families sued the school in court in Massachusetts. They sued the school district and its workers: principals, teachers, and other staff. They said the school workers broke a federal law that protects people's rights. Lawyers from two groups, the Massachusetts Family Institute and Child and Parental Rights Campaign, helped the parents. The parents wanted the court to say the school's rule was against the law of the land. They also wanted the court to make the school stop using this rule. And they asked for a little money for their trouble and to pay their lawyers.\n\nThe parents said schools shouldn't let teachers help students figure out their gender or change it. They especially felt teachers should not keep secrets from parents about a student's feelings about their gender, or if they wanted to change it. In 2012, the state's education board gave schools advice on how to handle this. This advice was just a suggestion. Schools didn't have to follow it. But the parents said the school should have followed this advice about telling parents. They said if a school didn't have its own rule, the state's advice should be used.\n\nOn July 29, 2022, the school asked the court to stop the lawsuit. They said the parents didn't have a good reason to sue. The school said the parents didn't have the right to sue in federal court. They said the parents didn't claim their own kids were transgender. And they didn't say their kids even talked to the school workers named in the lawsuit. This meant the parents didn't follow the rules for who can bring a case to court. These rules say you must show a real problem and that the school caused it. The school workers also said they had \"qualified immunity.\" This is a special protection for people who work for the government.\n\nOn December 14, 2022, Judge Mark Mastroianni agreed with the school. He threw out the case. He said the parents didn't have the right to sue. He also said that even if they could sue, their arguments wouldn't have been strong enough.

This right is part of the country's main law, the Constitution.\n\nThe court also said a certain legal test, called the \"shock-the-conscience\" test, was not the right one to use.

On April 12, 2022, two sets of parents filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The parents sued the school district and various officials, administrators, and teachers in their official capacity under 42 U.S.C. 1983. Represented by public interest attorneys for the Massachusetts Family Institute and Child and Parental Rights Campaign, the parents sought various declarations regarding the policy at issue to be unconstitutional, an injunction against adherence to the policy, nominal damages, compensatory damages, and attorneys&rsquo; fees.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs claimed that a school district may not empower individual teachers to assist students who are in the midst of a crisis of gender identity to transition and in particular to conceal in any manner the student's desire to transition or feelings on the matter from the parents either deliberately or accidentally. In 2012, the Massachusetts Board of Elementary and Secondary Education published guidance for school districts when faced with the instant issue. While the guidance has never been adopted as legally binding or as such to have substantive effect, the plaintiffs rely on the Board&rsquo;s suggestion for how individual school districts should handle informing parents of their children&rsquo;s gender identity crisis. The plaintiffs argued that in the absence of a local school district policy to the contrary, the Board&rsquo;s guidance should govern.</p>\r\n<p>On July 29, 2022, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Defendants argued that plaintiffs lacked Article III standing because they failed to allege that their children were transgender or had interacted with any of the defendants, failing both the cause or controversy requirement, traceability, and claim upon which relief could be granted requirements of standing. Defendants also asserted qualified immunity.</p>\r\n<p>District Judge Mark Mastroianni granted Defendant&rsquo;s motion to dismiss for lack of standing on December 14, 2022, and noted that in the alternative the allegations in the complaint would not have overcome the school district&rsquo;s qualified immunity. 2022 WL 18356421.

Driven by this conviction and a desire to assert their parental rights, two sets of these parents initiated legal action on April 12, 2022, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Their lawsuit, supported by public interest attorneys, was a direct challenge to the school district and its officials, seeking not only declarations that the school's policy was unconstitutional but also an injunction to halt its practice, along with damages and legal fees.\n\nAt the heart of the parents' grievance was their contention that school districts should not empower individual teachers to facilitate a student's gender transition or, crucially, to conceal such developments from parents. They pointed to 2012 guidance from the Massachusetts Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, which, though not legally binding, suggested how schools *should* handle informing parents about a child's gender identity crisis. The parents argued that, absent a local policy, this state guidance should have been followed, reflecting their expectation of transparency and involvement in their children's lives.\n\nHowever, the school district and its officials sought to quickly end the legal challenge. On July 29, 2022, they filed a motion to dismiss, strategically arguing that the parents lacked the necessary \"standing\" to bring their case in federal court. This procedural move aimed to demonstrate that the parents had not sufficiently shown a direct personal injury or connection to the alleged wrongdoing, or that their children were even directly affected, which are prerequisites for a federal lawsuit. They also claimed \"qualified immunity,\" a defense intended to shield public officials from liability for actions taken in their official capacity.\n\nThe District Judge, Mark Mastroianni, sided with the school officials on December 14, 2022, agreeing that the parents had not established the required standing to proceed with their claims. He also noted that, even if they had, their allegations likely wouldn't have overcome the school district's immunity. Undeterred, the parents continued their pursuit of justice, appealing the dismissal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit on January 11, 2023.\n\nYet, on February 18, 2025, the appellate court affirmed the lower court's decision. The court concluded that the parents had failed to plausibly demonstrate that the school's protocol infringed upon their fundamental constitutional right \"to direct the upbringing of their child.\" In essence, the court determined that the school's broad policy, applying to all students, did not constitute a direct enough governmental intrusion on parental rights to warrant judicial intervention under the specific legal standard applied.\n\nAs of February 19, 2025, this legal narrative continues to unfold.",

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit brought by four parents who argued this policy infringed upon their fundamental constitutional right to direct their children's upbringing.\n\nThese parents had sought to challenge the school's approach, contending that schools should not empower teachers to facilitate a student's gender transition or conceal such developments from parents, particularly given state guidance suggesting parental notification. Their legal action, brought under 42 U.S.C. 1983, aimed to declare the policy unconstitutional and secure an injunction against it.\n\nHowever, the District Court initially dismissed their claims, concluding the parents lacked the necessary standing, as they hadn't sufficiently demonstrated a direct personal injury or connection to the alleged wrongdoing, and noting their allegations likely wouldn't overcome the school district's immunity. The appellate court affirmed this dismissal, determining that the school's broad policy, applicable to all students, did not constitute a sufficiently direct governmental intrusion on parental rights to warrant judicial intervention under the specific legal standard applied. This outcome means the parents' challenge to the school's policy on parental notification regarding gender identity was unsuccessful, leaving the current practices in place as of February 19, 2025.",

They hoped to stop the school's practice and ensure parents were informed about their children's lives at school.\n\nHowever, their efforts faced a significant hurdle. A judge decided they hadn't shown enough personal connection to the issue to bring their concerns forward, and a higher court agreed. Ultimately, their plea was denied, meaning the schools could continue their current approach to students' gender identity without necessarily involving parents, as of February 19, 2025.",

On January 14, 2016, the case was removed to the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. The plaintiffs sued the Bloomfield Board of Education, the Manchester Board of Education, the Hartford Board of Education, the State Board of Education, and the State Department of Education under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, alleging violations of the Constitution of Connecticut, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Title VI.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that, after their expulsion from Connecticut public schools, they were given inadequate alternative education, thus depriving them of their fundamental right to an education. They argued that Black students were particularly affected by these inadequacies because Black students were disproportionately expelled as a result of selective enforcement of neutral discipline policies. One plaintiff brought claims against the Manchester and Bloomfield Boards of Education. Both plaintiffs brought claims against the Hartford Board of Education. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and the Center for Children&rsquo;s Advocacy, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief to improve the insufficient education provided to students who had been expelled. The plaintiffs also requested reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.</p>\r\n<p>On August 11, 2016, Manchester Board of Education defendants settled with one of the plaintiffs. This settlement is sealed.</p>\r\n<p>On August 16, 2016, the Bloomfield Board of Education also settled with the same plaintiff. The settlement agreement stipulated the Bloomfield BOE would provide $14,400 for education costs to be used until the 2019-2020 school year, would expunge the record of the plaintiff, would amend Board policies related to the expulsion of students, would define &ldquo;individualized learning plan&rdquo; to provided definition, would train administrators, teachers, and staff on changed policies and expelled students' rights, would provide plaintiff's counsel data about the District's progress in implementing this agreement, would acknowledge all allegations and that the District violated plaintiff's education rights, and would pay $20,000 in attorney fees.</p>\r\n<p>On December 22, 2016, Hartford Board of Education settled with both plaintiffs. That settlement agreement is also sealed. This left only the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims against State defendants.</p>\r\n<p>On July 16, 2018, State defendants settled with both plaintiffs. The settlement provided that the State Department of Education would provide guidance to the local education agencies about the expulsion-related provisions of Connecticut Public Act 16-147, addressing the process and timeline for district adoption of a prior expulsion hearing decision for students who transfer school districts during periods of expulsion. The State Department of Education also agreed to issue guidelines about best practices for the education the student should receive if expelled, and to circulate these guidelines to the local education agencies, boards of education and school districts at the same time, no longer than September 1, 2018. Moreover, the State Department of Education agreed to submit to the State Board of Education a proposed Board Policy Statement concerning the importance of reducing expulsions and disproportionality in expulsions, among other points, in Connecticut for consideration by the State Board no later than its December 2018 regular meeting. According to the settlement agreement, within 15 days after such time as the State Board issued a final Policy Statement, the State Department of Education should circulate it to local education agencies, boards of education and school districts.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, the State Department of Education, no later than September 1, 2018, would facilitate state oversight of alternative educational opportunities by publishing on its website, in a manner easily accessible to students and families, materials providing information for students and parents about student rights to education during periods of expulsion. These materials would also be published as part of the guidelines mentioned above, and would be sent by the State Department of Education via electronic mail to a list of agreed-upon community and legal organizations. The State Department of Education agreed to consider recommendations from the Plaintiffs' attorney in these resources, although the decision about their content would be made solely by the State Department.</p>\r\n<p>The State Department of Education agreed to analyze suspension and expulsion data on an annual basis, to identify districts with meaningful disparities in the rates of these punishments and racial disparities in suspensions/expulsions. The methodology of this analysis would be determined by the State Department of Education and shared with the plaintiffs and their counsel within 30 days of the execution of the settlement agreement, whose considerations, if made within 15 days, would be taken into account before a final decision was reached.</p>\r\n<p>Besides that, the State Department of Education agreed to develop a tiered monitoring and recommended remediation approach of progressive intervention generally consisting of guidance for all districts, including sharing of resources pertaining to restorative and culturally responsive practices, and, as justified by the particular circumstances it defined, more significant interventions for some districts, to be defined by the Department. Beginning in December 2020, the State Department of Education would annually determine the tiers of intervention, publish the results on its website and report the tiers annually to the State Board of Education. Beginning no later than December 2021, the State Department of Education would include in its annual reporting on the website and to the State Board of Education information concerning the progress of districts in Tier 3 toward improvement.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the State defendants agreed to pay $50,000 in fees and costs, and the plaintiffs waived any rights to apply for any additional fees and expenses in connection with all claims and potential claims resolved through the settlement agreement.</p>\r\n<p>The parties agreed the Court would retain jurisdiction until March 31, 2022 to enforce the provisions of the agreement.</p>\r\n<p>On July 18, 2018, Judge Stefan R.

Plaintiffs sued the Bloomfield, Manchester, and Hartford Boards of Education, along with the State Board of Education and the State Department of Education. Their claims, brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, alleged violations of the Connecticut Constitution, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and Title VI.\n\nPlaintiffs claimed that their expulsion from Connecticut public schools resulted in inadequate alternative education, thereby depriving them of their fundamental right to an education. They contended that Black students were disproportionately affected by these educational inadequacies due to selective enforcement of neutral discipline policies leading to higher expulsion rates. One plaintiff brought claims against the Manchester and Bloomfield Boards of Education, while both plaintiffs asserted claims against the Hartford Board of Education. Represented by private counsel and the Center for Children’s Advocacy, plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to improve education for expelled students, in addition to reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.\n\nThe Manchester Board of Education defendants settled with one plaintiff on August 11, 2016, under sealed terms.\n\nOn August 16, 2016, the Bloomfield Board of Education also settled with the same plaintiff. The settlement stipulated that the Bloomfield BOE would provide financial compensation for educational costs, expunge the plaintiff's record, amend Board policies related to student expulsions (including defining \"individualized learning plan\" and training staff on new policies and expelled student rights), provide plaintiff's counsel data on implementation progress, acknowledge that the District violated the plaintiff's education rights, and pay attorney fees.\n\nThe Hartford Board of Education settled with both plaintiffs on December 22, 2016, under a sealed agreement. This left only the plaintiffs’ claims against the State defendants.\n\nOn July 16, 2018, the State defendants settled with both plaintiffs. The settlement provided that the State Department of Education (SDE) would provide guidance to local education agencies (LEAs) regarding the expulsion-related provisions of Connecticut Public Act 16-147, specifically addressing the process and timeline for district adoption of prior expulsion hearing decisions for students transferring school districts during periods of expulsion. The SDE also agreed to issue and circulate guidelines on best practices for the education of expelled students to LEAs, boards of education, and school districts. Furthermore, the SDE committed to submitting a proposed Board Policy Statement to the State Board of Education concerning the importance of reducing expulsions and disproportionality in expulsions, which, once finalized by the State Board, would be circulated to LEAs, boards of education, and school districts.\n\nAdditionally, the SDE would facilitate state oversight of alternative educational opportunities by publishing easily accessible online materials for students and families detailing their rights to education during periods of expulsion. These materials would also be included in the aforementioned guidelines and disseminated via electronic mail to agreed-upon community and legal organizations. The SDE agreed to consider recommendations from the plaintiffs' attorney regarding these resources.\n\nThe SDE further committed to annually analyzing suspension and expulsion data to identify districts with meaningful disparities in punishment rates and racial disparities. The methodology for this analysis would be determined by the SDE and shared with plaintiffs and their counsel for consideration.\n\nMoreover, the SDE agreed to develop a tiered monitoring and recommended remediation approach involving progressive intervention.

Their claims, brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, alleged violations of the Connecticut Constitution, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and Title VI.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that their expulsion from Connecticut public schools led to inadequate alternative education, thereby infringing upon their fundamental right to an education. They contended that Black students were disproportionately impacted by these educational deficiencies due to selective enforcement of neutral discipline policies, resulting in higher expulsion rates. One plaintiff asserted claims against the Manchester and Bloomfield Boards of Education; both plaintiffs sued the Hartford Board of Education. Represented by private counsel and the Center for Children’s Advocacy, plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to enhance educational provisions for expelled students, alongside reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.\n\nThe Manchester Board of Education defendants settled with one plaintiff on August 11, 2016, under sealed terms.\n\nOn August 16, 2016, the Bloomfield Board of Education also settled with the same plaintiff. This settlement stipulated that the Bloomfield BOE would provide financial compensation for educational costs, expunge the plaintiff's record, amend Board policies concerning student expulsions, acknowledge the District's violation of the plaintiff's education rights, and pay attorney fees.\n\nThe Hartford Board of Education settled with both plaintiffs on December 22, 2016, under a sealed agreement, leaving only the claims against the State defendants.\n\nOn July 16, 2018, the State defendants settled with both plaintiffs. The settlement mandated that the State Department of Education (SDE) provide guidance to local education agencies (LEAs) on expulsion-related provisions of Connecticut Public Act 16-147, specifically concerning the adoption of prior expulsion decisions for transferring students. The SDE also agreed to issue and circulate guidelines on best practices for the education of expelled students to LEAs, boards of education, and school districts. Furthermore, the SDE committed to submitting a proposed Board Policy Statement to the State Board of Education regarding the reduction of expulsions and disproportionality, for circulation post-finalization to LEAs, boards of education, and school districts.\n\nAdditionally, the SDE would facilitate state oversight of alternative educational opportunities by publishing accessible online materials for students and families detailing their rights to education during expulsion. These materials would be integrated into the aforementioned guidelines and disseminated to agreed-upon community and legal organizations, with the SDE considering recommendations from plaintiffs' counsel.\n\nThe SDE further committed to annually analyzing suspension and expulsion data to identify districts exhibiting significant disparities in punishment rates and racial disparities.

On January 14, 2016, the case was removed to the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. The plaintiffs sued the Bloomfield Board of Education, the Manchester Board of Education, the Hartford Board of Education, the State Board of Education, and the State Department of Education under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, alleging violations of the Constitution of Connecticut, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Title VI.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that, after their expulsion from Connecticut public schools, they were given inadequate alternative education, thus depriving them of their fundamental right to an education. They argued that Black students were particularly affected by these inadequacies because Black students were disproportionately expelled as a result of selective enforcement of neutral discipline policies. One plaintiff brought claims against the Manchester and Bloomfield Boards of Education. Both plaintiffs brought claims against the Hartford Board of Education. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and the Center for Children&rsquo;s Advocacy, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief to improve the insufficient education provided to students who had been expelled. The plaintiffs also requested reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.</p>\r\n<p>On August 11, 2016, Manchester Board of Education defendants settled with one of the plaintiffs. This settlement is sealed.</p>\r\n<p>On August 16, 2016, the Bloomfield Board of Education also settled with the same plaintiff. The settlement agreement stipulated the Bloomfield BOE would provide $14,400 for education costs to be used until the 2019-2020 school year, would expunge the record of the plaintiff, would amend Board policies related to the expulsion of students, would define &ldquo;individualized learning plan&rdquo; to provided definition, would train administrators, teachers, and staff on changed policies and expelled students' rights, would provide plaintiff's counsel data about the District's progress in implementing this agreement, would acknowledge all allegations and that the District violated plaintiff's education rights, and would pay $20,000 in attorney fees.</p>\r\n<p>On December 22, 2016, Hartford Board of Education settled with both plaintiffs. That settlement agreement is also sealed. This left only the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims against State defendants.</p>\r\n<p>On July 16, 2018, State defendants settled with both plaintiffs. The settlement provided that the State Department of Education would provide guidance to the local education agencies about the expulsion-related provisions of Connecticut Public Act 16-147, addressing the process and timeline for district adoption of a prior expulsion hearing decision for students who transfer school districts during periods of expulsion. The State Department of Education also agreed to issue guidelines about best practices for the education the student should receive if expelled, and to circulate these guidelines to the local education agencies, boards of education and school districts at the same time, no longer than September 1, 2018. Moreover, the State Department of Education agreed to submit to the State Board of Education a proposed Board Policy Statement concerning the importance of reducing expulsions and disproportionality in expulsions, among other points, in Connecticut for consideration by the State Board no later than its December 2018 regular meeting.

              "transformed_text": "On December 15, 2015, two African-American students in Connecticut public schools filed this lawsuit in Connecticut Superior Court. On January 14, 2016, the case was moved to the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. The plaintiffs sued the Bloomfield Board of Education, the Manchester Board of Education, the Hartford Board of Education, the State Board of Education, and the State Department of Education under federal civil rights laws, specifically 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. They claimed violations of the Connecticut Constitution, the U.S. Constitution's Equal Protection Clause (part of the Fourteenth Amendment), and Title VI.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that after being expelled from Connecticut public schools, they did not receive proper alternative education, which denied them their basic right to an education. They claimed this problem especially affected Black students because they were expelled at a much higher rate due to how discipline policies were applied. One plaintiff brought claims against the Manchester and Bloomfield Boards of Education. Both plaintiffs brought claims against the Hartford Board of Education. The plaintiffs, represented by private lawyers and the Center for Children’s Advocacy, asked the court to declare their rights and order changes to improve the inadequate education given to expelled students. The plaintiffs also requested reasonable attorney fees and costs.\n\nOn August 11, 2016, the Manchester Board of Education settled with one of the plaintiffs. This settlement is sealed.\n\nOn August 16, 2016, the Bloomfield Board of Education also settled with the same plaintiff. Under the settlement, the Bloomfield BOE agreed to: provide $14,400 for education costs through the 2019-2020 school year; remove the expulsion from the plaintiff's record; change its policies on student expulsions; provide a definition for \"individualized learning plan\"; train administrators, teachers, and staff on new policies and expelled students' rights; share data with the plaintiff's lawyers about how it was meeting the agreement; admit the District had violated the plaintiff's education rights; and pay $20,000 in attorney fees.\n\nOn December 22, 2016, the Hartford Board of Education settled with both plaintiffs. That settlement agreement is also sealed. This left only the plaintiffs’ claims against State defendants.\n\nOn July 16, 2018, the State defendants settled with both plaintiffs. The settlement required the State Department of Education (SDE) to guide local school districts on the expulsion rules in Connecticut Public Act 16-147. This included details on how districts should handle expulsion decisions for students who transfer while expelled. The SDE also agreed to create and share guidelines for best practices regarding education for expelled students. These guidelines were to be sent to local education agencies, school boards, and districts by September 1, 2018. In addition, the SDE agreed to propose a policy statement to the State Board of Education by its December 2018 meeting. This statement would highlight the importance of reducing expulsions and addressing the unequal rates of expulsions in Connecticut. Once the State Board issued its final policy statement, the SDE was to distribute it to local education agencies, school boards, and districts within 15 days.\n\nBy September 1, 2018, the SDE also committed to improving state oversight of alternative education options. It would do this by publishing easy-to-access information on its website for students and families about their right to education during expulsion periods. These materials would also be included in the guidelines mentioned earlier and emailed to a list of agreed-upon community and legal groups. The SDE agreed to consider suggestions from the plaintiffs' attorney for these resources, but the SDE alone would decide the final content.\n\nThe SDE agreed to annually review suspension and expulsion data. This analysis would identify districts with significant differences in punishment rates, especially racial disparities in suspensions and expulsions. The SDE would decide how to conduct this analysis and share its plan with the plaintiffs and their lawyers within 30 days of the settlement. The SDE would consider any feedback from the plaintiffs' lawyers, if given within 15 days, before finalizing the plan.\n\nAdditionally, the SDE agreed to create a phased system for monitoring and helping districts improve. This system would involve general guidance for all districts, including sharing resources on practices that focus on repairing harm and are sensitive to different cultures. For some districts, based on specific circumstances, the SDE would define and implement more significant interventions. Starting in December 2020, the SDE would annually determine these intervention levels, publish the results online, and report them to the State Board of Education. By December 2021, the SDE would also include information in its annual online and State Board reports about how districts in the highest intervention tier (Tier 3) were improving.\n\nFinally, the State defendants agreed to pay $50,000 in legal fees and costs. The plaintiffs, in turn, gave up their right to seek any more fees or expenses related to the claims settled in the agreement.\n\nThe parties agreed the Court would keep oversight until March 31, 2022, to ensure the agreement's terms were met.\n\nOn July 18, 2018, Judge Stefan R. Underhill approved the settlement and the agreement to dismiss the case. The Court's oversight ended on March 31, 2022.",

              "transformed_text": "Imagine two students in Connecticut felt like their schools weren't treating them fairly, especially after they were kicked out (expelled). On December 15, 2015, these two African-American students started a lawsuit in a Connecticut state court. The case was later moved to a federal court on January 14, 2016.\n\nThey sued several school groups: the school boards for Bloomfield, Manchester, and Hartford, plus the State Board of Education and the State Department of Education (which oversees all schools in the state). They said these groups broke state laws (the Connecticut Constitution) and federal laws. The federal laws included the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which is like a rule saying everyone should be treated fairly by the government, and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which stops schools that get federal money from treating students differently because of their race. They also used a federal law called Section 1983, which lets people sue government officials if their civil rights (like the right to fair treatment) are violated.\n\nThe students argued that after being kicked out of school, they didn't get a good alternative education. This meant they were denied their basic right to learn. They pointed out that this problem hit Black students especially hard. They said Black students were expelled much more often because of how school discipline rules were used. One student sued the Manchester and Bloomfield school boards. Both students sued the Hartford school board. The students, with help from private lawyers and a group called the Center for Children’s Advocacy, asked the court to clearly state their rights and make the schools change how they educate expelled students. They also asked for their legal fees to be paid.\n\nOn August 11, 2016, the Manchester school board reached an agreement with one of the students. What they agreed to is private (sealed).\n\nA few days later, on August 16, 2016, the Bloomfield school board also settled with that same student. In their agreement, the Bloomfield school board promised to: give $14,400 for the student's education until the 2019-2020 school year; erase the expulsion from the student's school record; update its rules about expelling students; explain what an \"individualized learning plan\" means; teach school leaders, teachers, and staff about the new rules and the rights of expelled students; share information with the student's lawyers to show they were following the agreement; admit that the school district had violated the student's right to an education; and pay $20,000 for the student's legal fees.\n\nOn December 22, 2016, the Hartford school board settled with both students. That agreement is also private. After this, the only groups left to sue were the state education agencies.\n\nOn July 16, 2018, the State of Connecticut also reached an agreement with both students. The agreement said the State Department of Education (SDE) had to help local school districts understand and follow the rules about expulsions in a Connecticut law called Public Act 16-147. This included explaining how schools should deal with expulsion decisions for students who move to a new district while they are still expelled. The SDE also agreed to create and share a guide of the best ways to educate students who have been expelled. This guide was to be sent to all local school groups, boards, and districts by September 1, 2018. Also, the SDE agreed to suggest a new official statement to the State Board of Education by their December 2018 meeting. This statement would emphasize how important it is to have fewer expulsions and to fix the problem where some groups of students are expelled more often than others in Connecticut. Once the State Board made its final decision on this statement, the SDE had to send it out to local school groups within 15 days.\n\nBy September 1, 2018, the SDE also promised to do a better job of overseeing alternative education programs (like special schools for expelled students). They would do this by putting easy-to-find information on their website for students and families about their right to an education even when they are expelled. These materials would also be part of the guide mentioned before and sent by email to specific community and legal groups. The SDE said they would listen to ideas from the students' lawyer for these materials, but the SDE would make the final decisions on what they said.\n\nThe SDE agreed to look at information (data) about student suspensions and expulsions every year. This check would help them find school districts where there were big differences in how often students were disciplined, especially if Black students or other racial groups were suspended or expelled much more often. The SDE would decide how to do this check and share their plan with the students and their lawyers within 30 days of the agreement. They would consider any ideas from the students' lawyers, if given within 15 days, before making the plan final.\n\nAlso, the SDE agreed to create a step-by-step system to check on schools and help them get better. This system would give general advice to all school districts, including sharing ideas about how to fix problems in a way that helps everyone involved and respects different cultures. For some districts, depending on their specific situations, the SDE would step in with more serious help or changes. Starting in December 2020, the SDE would decide these levels of help every year, share the results online, and tell the State Board of Education. By December 2021, the SDE would also include updates in their yearly online and State Board reports about how districts needing the most help (Tier 3) were getting better.\n\nFinally, the state groups agreed to pay $50,000 for the students' legal fees and other costs. In return, the students agreed not to ask for any more money for legal fees or costs related to the issues they settled.\n\nEveryone involved agreed that the court would keep an eye on things until March 31, 2022, to make sure the agreement was followed. On July 18, 2018, Judge Stefan R. Underhill approved the agreement and closed the case. The court's role in overseeing the agreement ended on March 31, 2022.",

              "transformed_text": "Two students in Connecticut felt their schools were unfair. Especially after they were kicked out, or expelled. On December 15, 2015, these two Black students sued in a Connecticut state court. The case moved to a federal court on January 14, 2016.\n\nThey sued several school groups. These included the school boards for Bloomfield, Manchester, and Hartford. They also sued the State Board of Education and the State Department of Education. These state groups oversee all schools. The students said these groups broke state and federal laws. Federal laws they mentioned were the Equal Protection Clause. This rule says the government must treat everyone fairly. Another was Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. This law stops schools from treating students differently because of their race. This applies to schools that get money from the government. They also used a law called Section 1983. This law lets people sue government workers if their rights are broken.\n\nThe students said they did not get a good education after being expelled. They said this took away their right to learn. They noted this problem affected Black students the most. Black students were expelled more often. This was due to how school rules were used. One student sued the Manchester and Bloomfield school boards. Both students sued the Hartford school board. The students had help from lawyers and a group called the Center for Children’s Advocacy. They asked the court to say what their rights were. They also wanted schools to change how they taught expelled students. They also wanted their lawyer fees paid.\n\nOn August 11, 2016, the Manchester school board made a deal with one student. The details of this deal are private.\n\nA few days later, on August 16, 2016, the Bloomfield school board also made a deal with that same student. In their deal, the Bloomfield school board promised to:\n* Give $14,400 for the student's education until the 2019-2020 school year.\n* Remove the expulsion from the student's school record.\n* Change its rules about expelling students.\n* Explain what an \"individualized learning plan\" is.\n* Teach school leaders, teachers, and staff about the new rules. They would also learn about the rights of expelled students.\n* Share information with the student's lawyers. This would show they were following the deal.\n* Say that the school district had broken the student's right to an education.\n* Pay $20,000 for the student's lawyer fees.\n\nOn December 22, 2016, the Hartford school board made a deal with both students. That deal is also private. After this, only the state education groups were still being sued.\n\nOn July 16, 2018, the State of Connecticut also made a deal with both students. The deal said the State Department of Education (SDE) had to help local schools. They needed to understand and follow rules about expulsions. These rules were in a Connecticut law called Public Act 16-147. This included explaining how schools should handle students who move to a new area while still expelled. The SDE also agreed to make a guide. This guide would show the best ways to teach expelled students. This guide would go to all local school groups by September 1, 2018. Also, the SDE agreed to suggest a new official statement. This would go to the State Board of Education by December 2018. This statement would say it's important to have fewer expulsions. It would also say to fix the problem of some student groups being expelled more often in Connecticut. Once the State Board decided on this statement, the SDE had to send it to local school groups within 15 days.\n\nBy September 1, 2018, the SDE also promised to watch over alternative education programs better. These are like special schools for expelled students. They would put easy-to-find information on their website. This would tell students and families about their right to an education even when expelled. These materials would also be in the guide. They would also be emailed to certain community and legal groups. The SDE would listen to ideas from the students' lawyer. But the SDE would decide what the materials said.\n\nThe SDE agreed to check information about student suspensions and expulsions every year. This check would help them find schools where students were disciplined very differently. Especially if Black students or other racial groups were suspended or expelled much more often. The SDE would decide how to do this check. They would share their plan with the students and their lawyers within 30 days of the deal. They would think about ideas from the students' lawyers. These ideas had to be given within 15 days. Then the SDE would make the plan final.\n\nAlso, the SDE agreed to create a step-by-step system. This system would check on schools and help them improve. This system would give advice to all schools. It would share ideas on how to fix problems. These ideas would help everyone and respect different cultures. For some schools, the SDE would give more serious help. This would depend on their situation. Starting in December 2020, the SDE would decide how much help each year. They would share the results online. They would also tell the State Board of Education. By December 2021, the SDE would also add updates to their yearly reports. These reports would show how schools needing the most help (Tier 3) were getting better.\n\nFinally, the state groups agreed to pay $50,000 for the students' lawyer fees and other costs. In return, the students agreed not to ask for more money for lawyer fees related to the deal.\n\nEveryone agreed the court would watch until March 31, 2022. This was to make sure the deal was followed. On July 18, 2018, Judge Stefan R. Underhill approved the deal. He closed the case. The court stopped watching the deal on March 31, 2022.",

              "text": "<p>On December 15, 2015, two African-American students in Connecticut public schools filed this lawsuit in Connecticut Superior Court. On January 14, 2016, the case was removed to the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. The plaintiffs sued the Bloomfield Board of Education, the Manchester Board of Education, the Hartford Board of Education, the State Board of Education, and the State Department of Education under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, alleging violations of the Constitution of Connecticut, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Title VI.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that, after their expulsion from Connecticut public schools, they were given inadequate alternative education, thus depriving them of their fundamental right to an education. They argued that Black students were particularly affected by these inadequacies because Black students were disproportionately expelled as a result of selective enforcement of neutral discipline policies. One plaintiff brought claims against the Manchester and Bloomfield Boards of Education. Both plaintiffs brought claims against the Hartford Board of Education. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and the Center for Children&rsquo;s Advocacy, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief to improve the insufficient education provided to students who had been expelled. The plaintiffs also requested reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.</p>\r\n<p>On August 11, 2016, Manchester Board of Education defendants settled with one of the plaintiffs. This settlement is sealed.</p>\r\n<p>On August 16, 2016, the Bloomfield Board of Education also settled with the same plaintiff. The settlement agreement stipulated the Bloomfield BOE would provide $14,400 for education costs to be used until the 2019-2020 school year, would expunge the record of the plaintiff, would amend Board policies related to the expulsion of students, would define &ldquo;individualized learning plan&rdquo; to provided definition, would train administrators, teachers, and staff on changed policies and expelled students' rights, would provide plaintiff's counsel data about the District's progress in implementing this agreement, would acknowledge all allegations and that the District violated plaintiff's education rights, and would pay $20,000 in attorney fees.</p>\r\n<p>On December 22, 2016, Hartford Board of Education settled with both plaintiffs. That settlement agreement is also sealed. This left only the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims against State defendants.</p>\r\n<p>On July 16, 2018, State defendants settled with both plaintiffs. The settlement provided that the State Department of Education would provide guidance to the local education agencies about the expulsion-related provisions of Connecticut Public Act 16-147, addressing the process and timeline for district adoption of a prior expulsion hearing decision for students who transfer school districts during periods of expulsion. The State Department of Education also agreed to issue guidelines about best practices for the education the student should receive if expelled, and to circulate these guidelines to the local education agencies, boards of education and school districts at the same time, no longer than September 1, 2018. Moreover, the State Department of Education agreed to submit to the State Board of Education a proposed Board Policy Statement concerning the importance of reducing expulsions and disproportionality in expulsions, among other points, in Connecticut for consideration by the State Board no later than its December 2018 regular meeting. According to the settlement agreement, within 15 days after such time as the State Board issued a final Policy Statement, the State Department of Education should circulate it to local education agencies, boards of education and school districts.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, the State Department of Education, no later than September 1, 2018, would facilitate state oversight of alternative educational opportunities by publishing on its website, in a manner easily accessible to students and families, materials providing information for students and parents about student rights to education during periods of expulsion. These materials would also be published as part of the guidelines mentioned above, and would be sent by the State Department of Education via electronic mail to a list of agreed-upon community and legal organizations. The State Department of Education agreed to consider recommendations from the Plaintiffs' attorney in these resources, although the decision about their content would be made solely by the State Department.</p>\r\n<p>The State Department of Education agreed to analyze suspension and expulsion data on an annual basis, to identify districts with meaningful disparities in the rates of these punishments and racial disparities in suspensions/expulsions. The methodology of this analysis would be determined by the State Department of Education and shared with the plaintiffs and their counsel within 30 days of the execution of the settlement agreement, whose considerations, if made within 15 days, would be taken into account before a final decision was reached.</p>\r\n<p>Besides that, the State Department of Education agreed to develop a tiered monitoring and recommended remediation approach of progressive intervention generally consisting of guidance for all districts, including sharing of resources pertaining to restorative and culturally responsive practices, and, as justified by the particular circumstances it defined, more significant interventions for some districts, to be defined by the Department. Beginning in December 2020, the State Department of Education would annually determine the tiers of intervention, publish the results on its website and report the tiers annually to the State Board of Education. Beginning no later than December 2021, the State Department of Education would include in its annual reporting on the website and to the State Board of Education information concerning the progress of districts in Tier 3 toward improvement.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the State defendants agreed to pay $50,000 in fees and costs, and the plaintiffs waived any rights to apply for any additional fees and expenses in connection with all claims and potential claims resolved through the settlement agreement.</p>\r\n<p>The parties agreed the Court would retain jurisdiction until March 31, 2022 to enforce the provisions of the agreement.</p>\r\n<p>On July 18, 2018, Judge Stefan R. Underhill approved the settlement agreement and stipulation of dismissal. On March 31, 2022, the Court's jurisdiction expired.</p>",

              "transformed_text": "In December 2015, two African-American students in Connecticut initiated a legal challenge, seeking to rectify what they viewed as a systemic failure in the state's educational system. Their lawsuit, initially filed in state court but soon moved to the federal arena, targeted multiple entities—the Bloomfield, Manchester, and Hartford Boards of Education, alongside the State Board of Education and the State Department of Education. They brought claims under federal civil rights laws and the state constitution, asserting that their fundamental right to an education had been violated.\n\nAt the heart of their complaint was the assertion that after being expelled from public schools, they were relegated to inadequate alternative education, effectively denying them their fundamental right to learn. Crucially, they contended that this issue disproportionately harmed Black students, who, they argued, faced selective enforcement of discipline policies leading to higher expulsion rates. With the support of private counsel and the Center for Children’s Advocacy, the students sought not just acknowledgment of these wrongs, but also court-ordered changes to improve the educational provisions for all expelled students, alongside compensation for their legal expenses.\n\nAs the litigation progressed, the local school boards began to address the students' concerns through settlements. In August 2016, the Manchester and Bloomfield Boards of Education reached agreements with one of the plaintiffs. The Bloomfield settlement, in particular, offered a clear path forward: it provided funds for the student's education, expunged their disciplinary record, and committed the Board to revise its expulsion policies, define individualized learning plans, and train staff on new procedures and student rights, acknowledging past violations. By December 2016, the Hartford Board of Education also settled with both students, leaving only the broader claims against the state-level defendants to be resolved.\n\nThe most significant resolution came in July 2018, when the State defendants agreed to a comprehensive settlement with both plaintiffs. This agreement reflected the students' broader ambition to effect systemic change across Connecticut. The State Department of Education committed to a series of initiatives designed to improve the educational landscape for expelled students statewide. These included providing clear guidance to local agencies on expulsion policies, issuing best practice guidelines for alternative education, and proposing a statewide policy statement to the State Board of Education emphasizing the reduction of expulsions and racial disparities. Further, the state agreed to enhance oversight by publishing accessible information for students and families about their educational rights during expulsion, and crucially, to annually analyze suspension and expulsion data to identify districts with significant disparities. This data-driven approach would inform a tiered system of intervention, ranging from general guidance to more targeted support for districts needing improvement, with progress reported publicly and to the State Board of Education. These measures aimed to ensure that the issues raised by the students would be addressed on a statewide, ongoing basis.\n\nAs part of this landmark agreement, the State also agreed to cover a portion of the plaintiffs' legal fees and costs. To ensure the ambitious terms of the settlement were indeed carried out, the court wisely retained jurisdiction over the case until March 2022, allowing it to oversee the implementation of these far-reaching policy changes. With the court's approval of the settlement in July 2018, this significant chapter in Connecticut's educational history came to a close, its impact continuing to unfold as the agreed-upon reforms took root.",

              "transformed_text": "Connecticut's educational system underwent significant changes thanks to the determined advocacy of two African-American students. Their efforts led to a landmark agreement with the State, directly addressing the denial of adequate education for expelled students, particularly Black students who were disproportionately affected by discriminatory discipline policies.\n\nThis statewide resolution was the culmination of their persistent challenge to the state's practices, which began after their own expulsions from public schools. Initially, local school boards responded by reaching agreements. The Manchester and Bloomfield Boards of Education settled with one of the students. The Bloomfield agreement, in particular, provided a clear path forward: it funded the student's education, cleared their disciplinary record, and committed the Board to revise its expulsion policies, define individualized learning plans, and train staff on new procedures and student rights, acknowledging past violations. By December 2016, the Hartford Board of Education also reached an agreement with both students.\n\nThe most impactful outcome came when the State defendants committed to a comprehensive agreement with both students, reflecting their broader ambition for systemic change across Connecticut. The State Department of Education agreed to a series of initiatives designed to improve the educational landscape for expelled students statewide. This included providing clear guidance to local agencies on expulsion policies, issuing best practice guidelines for alternative education, and proposing a statewide policy statement to the State Board of Education emphasizing the reduction of expulsions and racial disparities.\n\nFurthermore, the state committed to enhancing oversight by publishing accessible information for students and families about their educational rights during expulsion. Crucially, it also agreed to annually analyze suspension and expulsion data to identify districts with significant disparities. This data-driven approach would inform a tiered system of intervention, ranging from general guidance to more targeted support for districts needing improvement, with progress reported publicly. These policy shifts aim to ensure that the issues raised by the students would be addressed on a statewide, ongoing basis, marking a significant step towards improving educational provisions for all expelled students in Connecticut. As part of this agreement, the State also contributed to the students' legal costs.",

They found themselves without proper education, a situation that seemed to hit Black students harder than others due to unfair rules about student behavior.\n\nRefusing to accept this, these two students decided to stand up for themselves and others like them. They sought help to change how things were done, first reaching out to their local school districts.\n\nTheir courage brought about real change. One student found a way forward with their local schools in Manchester and Bloomfield. The Bloomfield school, for instance, reached an understanding where they would pay for their continued learning, clear their student record, and rethink its rules for students who were sent away from school. They also pledged to create personal learning plans and train staff to understand student rights better, acknowledging past wrongs. Later, the Hartford school also found a way to help both students.\n\nBut the biggest change came when the entire State of Connecticut listened. The State's education leaders made a promise to transform the learning experience for all students who had been sent away from school. They would share clear advice with local schools on how to handle student dismissals, offer ideas for better alternative education, and even propose a statewide plan to reduce how often students were sent away, especially addressing the unfair differences for Black students.\n\nThe State also pledged to keep a close eye on things. They would make it easy for families to find information about their children's learning rights during these difficult times. Crucially, they would regularly look at numbers about student dismissals to spot schools where unfair patterns appeared. This information would guide a system of support, from general advice to more focused help for schools that needed to improve, with progress shared openly. These shifts in how things were done aimed to ensure the students' concerns would be taken care of across the entire state, making education better for all students who faced dismissal. As a final gesture, the State also helped cover the students' expenses.",

Connelly Youth Center (Roslindale) filed a class action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the Governor of Massachusetts, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief for allegedly unconstitutional conditions at Roslindale. The plaintiffs were represented by the Juvenile Court Advocacy Program and the Massachusetts Defenders Committee.\n\nFollowing pretrial conferences, the parties entered into a Consent Decree, which the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts (Judge Wendell Arthur Garrity, Jr.) ordered as binding judgment on April 2, 1976.\n\nThe Consent Decree outlined comprehensive reforms across several key areas. It mandated an end to the commingling of pretrial detainees with committed juveniles awaiting placement. Communication and access provisions included immediate parental notification upon a juvenile's admission and determination of legal representation. Detainees were granted rights regarding mail, including provision of postage for seven first-class letters weekly, and parcels opened in their presence. Structured visitation periods were established for parents and guardians, while attorneys and clergy had broad access. Local telephone calls of five-minute duration were available six days a week.\n\nStaffing requirements included screening current and future employees for emotional fitness, assigning individual counselors to detainees (with a counseling supervisor for every 45 detainees), and ensuring all employees underwent regular in-service training. Educational needs were to be met individually, with class sizes not exceeding 12 detainees. Medical care provisions included initial examinations by a doctor or registered nurse within 24 hours of admission and at least every four months thereafter, alongside access to psychiatric and emergency medical treatment.\n\nLiving conditions were significantly addressed, detailing minimum personal space of 75 square feet per detainee and a common room for every 20 detainees. Standards for cleanliness included a clean room upon admission, provision of clean mattresses, bedding, towels, toothbrushes, and toothpaste, with weekly bedding changes and twice-weekly towel changes. Detainees were guaranteed daily showers or baths, and provision of breakfast, an evening meal, and a snack. Specific outdoor recreation hours were mandated (minimum two hours on school days, four hours on non-school days), and access to games, books, and periodicals was required, with mandatory sleeping hours not exceeding 8 hours per night.\n\nFurthermore, the Decree strictly prohibited corporal punishment. It required clear communication of permitted and proscribed behavior to all detainees upon admission, stipulating that any restriction of rights due to behavior must arise from written rules available to detainees, and a hearing must be held on the matter as soon as possible.\n\nDefendants were given 8 months to achieve full compliance, with non-compliance potentially leading to closure. A five-member Monitoring Board was appointed for 2 years to submit findings and recommendations to the parties, initially bi-monthly and then quarterly. The Court (Judge Garrity) retained jurisdiction. No further docket information regarding the case's ultimate disposition is available.",

Think of a class action like a group of students all having the same problem with a school rule, so one student speaks up for everyone. In this case, it was a lawsuit filed for a whole group of young people who had similar complaints. They sued the Governor, saying that the conditions at Roslindale were so bad they actually went against their basic rights, which are protected by the U.S. Constitution.

This meant it was a final decision that everyone had to follow.\n\nThe Consent Decree laid out many rules: The DYS had to stop putting young people who were just waiting for their court date in the same living areas as those who had already been sentenced and were waiting to be moved to a different, more permanent place. Parents would be told right away when a young person was brought to Roslindale, and that young person would get a lawyer. Young people could send and receive mail freely, and packages could only be opened in front of them, just to check for things that weren't allowed. Roslindale would give them everything they needed to write and send letters, including stamps for seven regular letters each week. Parents and guardians could visit twice a week for two hours each time. Lawyers and religious leaders could visit any day, from 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM. They could make local phone calls, five minutes long, six days a week. All staff, new and old, had to be checked to make sure they were emotionally fit to work with kids in a detention center. Each young person would get a counselor to help them with problems from being held there, and for every 45 young people, there would be a supervisor for the counselors. All employees would get regular training. Each young person's education needs would be met, with no more than 12 students in a class. Every young person would see a doctor or nurse within 24 hours of arriving at Roslindale, and at least every four months after that. Mental health care and emergency medical help would be available to every young person. Each young person would have at least 75 square feet of their own space (about the size of a small bedroom). There would also be one common room for every 20 young people. When they arrived, each young person would get a clean room and be responsible for keeping it clean afterward. Each young person would get at least two hours of outdoor time on school days and four hours on days they didn't have school. Games, books, and magazines would be provided. They wouldn't be forced to sleep more than 8 hours per night. New young people would get clean mattresses, sheets, blankets, towels, toothbrushes, and toothpaste. Bedding would be cleaned weekly. All young people could take daily showers or baths, and towels would be changed twice a week. Breakfast and an evening meal would be provided. If the evening meal was served before 5:00 PM, a snack would be available afterward. Physical punishment was strictly forbidden. Rules about what behavior was allowed and not allowed would be clearly explained to all young people when they arrived. And if their rights were limited because of their behavior, it had to be based on written rules given to them, and they had to have a hearing about it as soon as possible.\n\nThe state officials had eight months to make sure Roslindale fully followed the agreement. If they didn't, the facility could be shut down. A special group of five people, called a Monitoring Board, was put in place for two years. This board would report what they found and their suggestions to both sides every two months for the first eight months, and then every three months after that.

They would get four hours on days they didn't have school.\n*   Games, books, and magazines would be provided.\n*   They wouldn't be forced to sleep more than 8 hours per night.\n*   New young people would get clean mattresses, sheets, blankets, towels, toothbrushes, and toothpaste.\n*   Bedding would be cleaned weekly.\n*   All young people could take daily showers or baths. Towels would be changed twice a week.\n*   Breakfast and dinner would be given. If dinner was served before 5:00 PM, they would get a snack later.\n*   Physical punishment was strictly forbidden.\n*   Rules about what behavior was allowed and not allowed would be clearly explained to all young people when they arrived.\n*   If their rights were limited because of their behavior, there had to be written rules. These rules had to be given to them. They also had to get a meeting about it very soon.\n\nThe state had eight months to follow the agreement completely. If they didn't, Roslindale could be closed down. A special group of five people was created. It was called a Monitoring Board. They would work for two years. This board would tell both sides what they found. They would also give suggestions. They would do this every two months for the first eight months. After that, it would be every three months. The court, with Judge Garrity still in charge, kept watch. They made sure the agreement was followed. We don't know how the case finally ended. There is no public record about it.",

              "transformed_text": "In 1975, a group of juveniles held at the Judge J. Connelly Youth Center (Roslindale), under the care of the Department of Youth Services (DYS), initiated a significant legal challenge. They brought a class action against the Governor of Massachusetts, driven by a deep concern over conditions they believed were unconstitutional. Their purpose in taking this legal step was to compel the state to acknowledge and rectify these alleged abuses, seeking court orders that would declare the conditions unlawful and mandate immediate improvements. Their cause was championed by the Juvenile Court Advocacy Program and the Massachusetts Defenders Committee.\n\nRather than proceeding to a full trial, the parties engaged in extensive negotiations, which culminated in a Consent Decree. This agreement, formalized by the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts (Judge Wendell Arthur Garrity, Jr.) on April 2, 1976, served as a binding judgment, signifying a mutual commitment to resolve the dispute and implement necessary reforms without further contentious litigation.\n\nThe Consent Decree laid out a comprehensive blueprint for reform, addressing the very grievances that had prompted the lawsuit. It mandated that DYS cease housing pretrial detainees with committed juveniles awaiting placement, ensuring proper segregation. It required prompt notification of parents and determination of legal representation upon a juvenile's entry to Roslindale. Communication with the outside world was to be protected, allowing detainees to send and receive mail freely, with parcels opened only in the addressee's presence for contraband checks. Roslindale was to provide writing materials and postage for seven first-class letters weekly. Visitation rights were significantly expanded, offering parents and guardians two-hour periods twice a week, and allowing attorneys and clergy unrestricted visits between 9:00 A.M. and 7:00 P.M. daily. Local telephone calls of five-minute duration were to be available six days a week. The agreement also focused on the well-being of the juveniles: current and future employees were to be screened for emotional fitness; each detainee was to have a dedicated counselor, with a counseling supervisor for every 45 detainees; and all staff were to receive regular in-service training. Educational needs were to be met individually, with class sizes capped at 12. Health provisions were stringent, requiring medical examination within 24 hours of admission and every four months thereafter, alongside access to psychiatric and emergency medical treatment. Living conditions were also addressed: each detainee was to have at least 75 square feet of personal space, with a common room for every 20 detainees; clean rooms upon admission, with detainees responsible for subsequent upkeep. Recreation was prioritized, with a minimum of two hours outdoor activity on school days and four hours on non-school days. Access to games, books, and periodicals was guaranteed. Sleeping hours were capped at 8 hours per night. Basic hygiene was ensured, with clean mattresses, bedding, towels, toothbrushes, and toothpaste provided upon admission, weekly bedding changes, and daily showers or baths with twice-weekly towel changes. Nutritional needs were met with breakfast, an evening meal, and a snack after the evening meal if served before 5:00 P.M. Finally, the decree strictly forbade corporal punishment and mandated clear communication of rules, ensuring that any restriction of rights due to behavior required written rules and a prompt hearing.\n\nTo ensure these extensive reforms were not merely promises but tangible realities, the agreement stipulated a strict 8-month deadline for Roslindale to achieve full compliance, with the severe consequence of closure for failure. Furthermore, a Monitoring Board of five individuals was established for a two-year term, tasked with submitting regular findings and recommendations to both parties. This oversight mechanism, combined with the Court's (Judge Garrity) decision to retain jurisdiction, underscored the commitment to sustained improvement and provided a means to enforce the decree should compliance falter. The ultimate disposition of the case beyond these initial measures remains unrecorded in the available historical documents.",
